cut to a row of dour communists in illfitting gray suits announcing gorbachevs illness and a palace coup
 kremlinologists who dabble in conspiracy theories are working overtime though they insist that their darkest imaginings be clearly labeled pure speculation
 once you have a palace coup the possibilities are endless said robert conquest a senior research fellow at the hoover institution
 for all we know conquest joked gorbachev could be injected with drugs to change his personality or kgb scientists could produce a bodydouble to impersonate him
 a more intriguing scenario has gorbachev conspiring with the coup plotters to engineer a transformation of the soviet political landscape
the thinking goes like this with his popularity at rock bottom gorbachev a lifelong creature of the kgb hatches a false coup in order to step out of the way while hardliners and liberals battle each other
 the theory could explain the apparent bungling of the coup plotters said author joseph finder whose  novel the moscow club foreshadowed many of the elements of the current crisis
 finder who said he did not subscribe to the scenario nonetheless pointed out that tanks did not begin to roll until hours after gorbachevs supposed arrest
 theorizing was rampant in the streets of moscow on tuesday said san francisco businesswoman kimberly getto who sent a long fax detailing speculation fueled by the fact that many of the tanks encircling the russian parliament building had no ammunition
 the democratic reform movement headed by former foreign minister eduard shevardnadze gorbachevs longtime ally floated the same possibility in a statement monday
 its highly implausible but not to be excluded that gorbachev himself agreed to a withdrawal thinking hed show them they still needed him said norman naimark director of stanfords center for russian and east european studies
in the united states president bush said he spoke to gorbachev and the soviet leader was calling the shots again
bush said the hardline coup leaders had underestimated the power of the people underestimated what a taste of freedom and democracy brings
 the coup one of the most tumultuous developments in recent soviet history unraveled in a series of swift and dramatic developments today check tanks and armored personnel carriers moved away from the russian parliament scene of the worst violence of the coup
said a soviet tv announcer grinning broadly after he was allowed for the first time to criticize the coup leaders actions
 check in the independenceminded baltic republics which had borne the brunt of the postcoup crackdown some soviet troops began returning to their permanent bases
 the coups failure could deal a fatal blow to organized highlevel efforts to thwart reform drives in the soviet union by gorbachev and yeltsin and significantly alter the balance of power that has characterized soviet power for the sixyear gorbachev era
although yeltsin supported gorbachev during the coup the two men maintain different approaches to soviet reforms
 gorbachevs foreign minister alexander bessmertnykh who had dropped out of sight during the coup reappeared today and called the takeover a page in soviet history that has got to be turned
 at a news conference bessmertnykh promised that reforms would continue and that moscow would honor its international commitments
 the national legislature invalidated all decrees made by the coup leaders national lawmaker yuri karyakin told the russian legislature
 word of gorbachevs imminent return to the capital came from lev y sukhanov a longtime yeltsin deputy
he said gorbachev would fly from his vacation retreat in the crimea to the soviet capital with vladimir ivashko the deputy generalsecretary of the communist party and other aides
it called the takeover unconstitutional and demanded a meeting with gorbachev the party chief the official news agency tass said
 thousands of people had kept up their vigil at the russian parliament building after overnight clashes with soviet troops that left at least four dead
 the plane reportedly carrying the coup leaders was said to be headed to the city of bishkek formerly called frunze the capital of kirgizia  miles southeast of moscow according to radio russia which speaks for yeltsin
 the radio said officials of the russian republic would try to intercept the plane and have its passengers arrested
 but sources at the airport told the associated press that only kgb chief vladimir kryuchkov was on a plane and it was headed to the crimea where gorbachev reportedly had been placed under house arrest
 the republicrun russian information agency said vice president gennady yanayev the nominal head of the coup committee was still in his kremlin office
 bush in maine told a news conference that yeltsin told him in a telephone call that he believed that five of the coup leaders left moscow and that one of them prime minister valentin pavlov was in the hospital
 despite the force brought to bear by the coup leaders they were unable to dislodge yeltsin from the russian parliament where he rallied the opposition to enforce the curfew or prevent large demonstrations nationwide
 the state of emergency was declared after hardline elements in the military and communist party ousted gorbachev declaring he was ill few believed it
 the junta had seemed unable to cope with tens of thousands of people who erected barricades around yeltsins stronghold in the parliament
 there were also huge anticoup demonstrations in moscow leningrad kishiniev and other cities as well as strikes by coal miners in siberia
 early today before the coup fell apart columns of tanks and armored personnel carriers had moved around central moscow
one patrol of the armored vehicles was trapped by furious demonstrators just after midnight as it tried to break through a barricade
 two people were confirmed shot or crushed to death as the vehicles tried to fight their way through and witnesses said a third person was killed
a russian republic official col viktor samailov told the independent news agency interfax that four people were shot or crushed to death in the clash
gorbachev was set to board a plane in the crimea where he was vacationing at the time of mondays coup for the twohour flight to moscow said a deputy to russian defense minister konstantin kobets
 the soviet leader in a statement for radio and television said he was fully in command of the situation and that the coup leaders would bear full responsibility for their actions
 in the united states president bush hailed gorbachevs return to power and said the coup leaders had underestimated the power of the people underestimated what a taste of freedom and democracy brings
 the threeday coup one of the most tumultuous developments in recent soviet history unraveled in a series of swift and dramatic developments today check tanks and armored personnel carriers moved away from the russian parliament scene of the worst violence of the coup
said a soviet tv announcer grinning broadly after he was allowed for the first time to criticize the coup leaders actions
 check in the secessionist baltic republics which had borne the brunt of the postcoup crackdown some soviet troops began returning to their permanent bases
 the coups failure could deal a fatal blow to organized highlevel efforts to thwart reform drives in the soviet union by gorbachev and yeltsin and significantly alter the balance of power that has characterized soviet power for the sixyear gorbachev era
although yeltsin supported gorbachev during the coup the two men maintain different approaches to soviet reforms
 yeltsin addressed the russian parliament today and said the soviet union had just gone through a most tragic moment in its history and perhaps the most tragic moment
 gorbachevs foreign minister alexander bessmertnykh who had dropped out of sight during the coup reappeared today and called the takeover a page in soviet history that has got to be turned
 the national legislature invalidated all decrees made by the coup leaders national lawmaker yuri karyakin told the russian legislature
it called the takeover unconstitutional and demanded a meeting with gorbachev the party chief the official news agency tass said
 thousands of people had kept up their vigil at the russian parliament building after overnight clashes with soviet troops that left at least four dead
 this shows the strength of our democracy said leonid abramtsov who was marching with a band of teenagers waving the red white and skyblue flag of the russian republic
 the plane reportedly carrying the coup leaders was said to be headed to the city of bishkek formerly called frunze the capital of kirgizia  miles southeast of moscow according to radio russia which speaks for yeltsin

a russian republic official col viktor samailov told the independent news agency interfax that four people were shot or crushed to death in the clash
at the news conference  gorbachevs first since the coup against him collapsed on wednesday  the yearold leader condemned the takeover as being against the people against democracy
 earlier he told reporters he would have killed himself rather than submit to any forced arrangement with the coup leaders
he named a new acting kgb chief interior minister and defense minister and said he would do everything to drive out the reactionary forces from the communist party
 gorbachev pledged cooperation with russian republic president boris yeltsin but said he had no plans to leave the communist party
 looking and sounding angry he described the plotters as primitive and crude and crafty and scoffed at their announcement that he had stepped aside because he was ill their hands were shaking the whole time he said derisively
 despite his display of anger the soviet president said the failure of the coup could ultimately help ensure the continuation of his reforms
 at his news conference gorbachev made a point of publicly praising yeltsin whose folkhero stature was enhanced during the coup as he rallied hundreds of thousands of his supporters to resist
 before dawn today gorbachev flew back to moscow from the crimea where he had been confined to his summer home during his brief ouster
 the soviet president who was reported to have slept for a few hours in his dacha outside moscow after returning from the crimea arrived at moscows vnukovo airport unannounced under heavy security
 appearing on soviet television after his arrival gorbachev looked haggard and unshaven with deep lines around his eyes and mouth
later at his news conference he at first spoke haltingly but then appeared to recover his composure and spoke in a forceful voice
 gorbachev said his captors cut off all communication and that his only source of news during the coup had been from foreign broadcasts including the bbc and voice of america received on a makeshift radio set up by his personal guards
 the yearold president said the crisis had been difficult for his family especially his wife raisa who took it very hard
 when it became clear the coup was failing gorbachev said he prepared himself and his family for the possibility that they would be killed by the conspirators
as soon as the hardliners made their move sunday night  two days before gorbachev was to sign the treaty  it was obvious the coup was doomed to failure they said
 one result of the bungled coup is that soviet president mikhail gorbachev  even though reinstated as head of state  could be irrelevant to what happens next analysts said
no one really came to gorbachevs assistance as leader of the country one us official said
instead opposition to the coup was based on the illegality of the principle of usurping power and widespread fear that if gorbachev could be rolled up then other democratically elected leaders could be too
 in the aftermath of the coup analysts also predicted that check major constraints on soviet cooperation with the west such as the militarys disaffection with gorbachevs support of bushs strategy during the persian gulf war will now be greatly weakened or removed although a benign soviet union cannot be assumed in every case
 check the coups abrupt end opened the way for faster democratic reforms but it will not now create jeffersonian democracy  or maybe ever
 check the communist party is dead and will no longer be a political force although most of the countrys bureaucrats are current or former party members
they thought the issue was mikhail gorbachev and apparently believed that by neutralizing gorbachev and threatening everyone else they could quickly take charge of the country
 but the people of the soviet union apparently concluded that the real issue was not gorbachev himself but the new political culture of freedom and even democracy that his reforms had created
that revolution will alter the country creating a new decentralized and probably smaller soviet union much more quickly than anyone anticipated
it seems unlikely that he can escape the consequences of his own past miscalculations  especially the miscalculation that led him to embrace the very men who led this putsch against his rule
gorbachev was the most resourceful and creative political leader of the late th century but this week he was trumped by boris yeltsin who will now rightly be seen as the man who saved him
one was the ability to stay close to the russian people as their world was transformed by gorbachevs revolution  hence his thumping victory in this springs first presidential election in russia and gorbachevs abysmal standing in the polls
yeltsins second talent was his eagerness to challenge the apparatus of the soviet communist party the world from which both he and gorbachev emerged
instead of reaching out to new ideas and new people as yeltsin has he surrounded himself with traditional communist party officials and worried about the impact of new schemes and ideas
gorbachev thought vladimir kryuchkov of the kgb boris pugo of the ministry of interior dmitri yazov of the red army and gennady yanayev of the communist party were necessary bedfellows whose presence in his entourage could protect him from conservative forces that hated his reforms
but when they closed the new liberal news media and reverted to the stalinist tradition of the big lie the members of the state emergency committee threatened not just gorbachev but also the new soviet union  a society that offered its citizens an unprecedented opportunity for dignity selfreliance and freedom
for years soviets and western kremlinologists had debated whether the changes that created this new soviet union were irreversible
he also refused to acquiesce to the state of emergency that those responsible for the coup apparently asked him to endorse last weekend
 it is intriguing in assessing the coups failure that men trained as thugs by some of the most violent and meanspirited institutions created by any state could not in their moment of truth behave like thugs and kill their compatriots
they left gorbachev alive and yeltsin at large they let the western media report their coup as it unfolded and they allowed foreign radio stations to broadcast news of it back into the country
even their own news media under strict control conveyed the fact that there was widespread resistance to their attempted coup
 by tuesday night the emergency committee was in a confrontation with the political legitimacy of yeltsin and this proved an unequal contest
as gorbachev had previously discovered in his negotiations with yeltsin over a new union treaty the legitimacy provided by the  million votes that yeltsin received in the elections for president of the russian federation was a formidable political force
 at first blush the botching of the coup was surprising  couldnt the vaunted kgb and its allies run an efficient putsch
perhaps their coup should be seen as a desperate and forlorn effort to deny a truth that proved undeniable  that the stalinist system had failed so utterly there was simply no way to redeem it
gorbachev threw out his foreign minister alexander bessmertnykh and his acting defense minister and named a new head of the kgb
 the moscow city council meanwhile ordered all communist party buildings in the capital sealed and all telephone service to party and kgb buildings cut
about  protesters blockaded the communist party headquarters in moscow declaring they were trying to prevent the removal of documents that might contain evidence linking party members to the coup
 yeltsin who had led the nationwide resistance to the coup announced a ban on communist party activities in the russian republic the army police units of the interior ministry and the kgb which for decades helped enforce communist rule
some of the many new decrees issued by yeltsin went beyond the official bounds of his power as russian federation president
 in his speech before the russian parliament gorbachev was compelled to affirm as legitimate the decrees issued by yeltsin during the threeday coup
it wasnt clear whether the soviet president had intended to back yeltsins latest decrees and he balked at proposals by russian deputies to outlaw the communist party saying it would divide the nation
 at one point during the session gorbachev dramatically held up what he said were the minutes of a secret cabinet meeting during the coup that revealed who backed the emergency decrees
 the meeting of gorbachev and yeltsin was the first since the coup collapsed to discuss the takeover and to deal with officials who backed the putsch
 in his speech gorbachev praised the outstanding role of yeltsin his sometimes adversary in halting the hardline communist coup
yeltsin has been a strong foe of communist party influence in the country gorbachev however warned in his speech against any kind of anticommunist hysteria
 yeltsin often commented during gorbachevs speech and gorbachev deferred to him several times on details of what happened during gorbachevs detention
 standing ovation the soviet presidents opening comments drew a standing ovation from the lawmakers in the parliament
yeltsin led the opposition to the coup from the parliament building where supporters rallied to build barricades and form a human shield against expected attacks
 as the face of the soviet government continued to change in the aftermath of the failed coup hundreds of angry residents marched toward communist party headquarters in moscow intent on proving the party was behind the coup

a kgb directive also banned any other political parties in the kgb for decades used by communist regimes to intimidate dissidents and anticommunist activists
 the arrest of the former kgb chief and other communist party hardliners inspired tens of thousands of demonstrators to undreamedof daring thursday
 they expressed their anger and disgust with the organizations responsible for killing millions of soviet citizens and now caught conspiring to return to their old dictatorship
 gorbachev and yeltsin the russian federation leader who saved gorbachev met today for the first time since the coup collapsed to discuss the takeover and deal with officials who backed the putsch
 in his speech gorbachev praised the outstanding role of yeltsin his sometimes adversary in halting the hardline communist coup
yeltsin has been a strong foe of communist party influence in the country gorbachev however warned in his speech against any kind of anticommunist hysteria
 yeltsin commented frequently during gorbachevs speech and gorbachev deferred to him several times on details of what happened while gorbachev was in detention
 his opening comments drew a standing ovation from the lawmakers in the parliament where yeltsin had led the opposition to the coup
 gorbachev also told the russian federation parliamentarians that the leaders of the hardline coup had sought to arrest yeltsin

 yeltsin who led the nationwide coup resistance today nationalized the hundreds of printing plants in the russian republic

a kgb directive also banned any other political parties in the kgb for decades used by communist regimes to intimidate dissidents and anticommunist activists
 as gorbachev and yeltsin met a crowd of about  people headed toward the communist party headquarters in moscow saying they wanted to capture and preserve records that might prove the party supported the coup
 calls for retribution have sounded since the dayold coup collapsed wednesday with gorbachev beginning a purge of coup plotters and thousands of cheering demonstrators toppling a statue outside the moscow headquarters of the kgb whose former leader backed the ouster attempt
 in in his speech to the russian federation parliament gorbachev said of bessmertnykh this morning i got information that at least he was trying to maneuver or worse during the coup attempt
 also dismissed was soviet parliamentary speaker anatoly lukyanov whom yeltsin had named as the chief ideologue of the plotters
 yeltsin who stature rose with his resistance in the coup said earlier that he would insist that proven reformers be installed in top jobs
 gorbachev told the legislators that he did not want now to name all those appointed to replace the hardliners but yeltsin said that gorbachev had agreed to appointing maj gen constantine kovets head of the army
 six newspapers suspended the six newspapers suspended by yeltsin all based in the russian republic are pravda sovietskaya rossiya glasnost rabochaya tribuna moskovskaya pravda and leninskoe znamya
 in other developments check gorbachev said he would meet today with leaders of the nine republics who support the new union treaty

 coup leader kills himself one of the coup leaders interior minister boris pugo committed suicide thursday by shooting himself in the head as he was about to be arrested officials said
 defense minister dmitri yazov was arrested and replaced by gen mikhail moiseyev the chief of the soviet general staff
yeltsin the triumphant leader of the resistance against this weeks military coup has drastically tipped the balance of power here showing himself to be at least the political equal if not the master of gorbachev
in a symbol of the new order the russian tricolor the banner of the anticoup resistance flew over the gates of the kremlin alongside the red soviet flag for the first time since the rise of the bolshevik state
 in a joint appearance with gorbachev in the russian parliament broadcast live on soviet television yeltsin made it clear that the soviet president can maintain a semblance of authority only if he agrees to share power and intensify the march toward a democratic political system and a market economy
 gorbachev who has insisted the party is still capable of reform stammered a bit and then said boris nikolayevich boris nikolayevich 
 yeltsin who clearly relished his emotional and political control of the parliament session also played a critical role in selecting the new heads of the kgb the defense ministry and the interior ministry police which until now have been bastions of opposition to reform
flouting protocol yeltsin was the first to announce the appointments while speaking at a mass rally friday morning outside kgb headquarters
 new appointees former interior minister vadim bakatin will head the kgb gen yevgeny shaposhnikov the air force chief becomes defense minister and former russian interior minister victor barannikov will be the unions interior minister
all three men took a clear stand against the coup and are expected to move quickly to reform the key institutions they now head
although bessmertnykh said he had refused to go along with the coup leaders gorbachev said he had information that his top diplomat had been maneuvering or at least did not take a firm stand
 bessmertnykh reacted with bitterness according to the tass news agency and claimed that he had refused to join the conservative uprising even though coup leader and former kgb chief vladimir kryuchkov had told him we need a liberal among us
moscow mayor gavril popov said investigators had to make a thorough search of party buildings and documents to determine the scope of the coup and its participants
across the country communist party leaders who opposed the coup quit their party posts and some who supported it such as latvian party leader alfred rubiks were arrested
 the leader of the russian orthodox church patriarch alexei ii said the coup meant the end of communist ideology in the country
 as gorbachev struggled during the minute session of the russian parliament he called for maturity and balance in judging the conspirators and said lets not have a witch hunt
 greeted by protesters from the moment that protesters outside the russian parliament building greeted the arrival of gorbachevs limousine with shouts of resign
when gorbachev had trouble at one point explaining one development in the coup yeltsin broke in like an exasperated schoolmaster
 yeltsin also seemed eager to impress on gorbachev just how thoroughly he had been betrayed by his own ministers and presumed allies
he handed gorbachev the minutes of a closed council of ministers meeting held last monday during which all of the more than  ministers present  with one or two exceptions  supported the coup and the state committee for the state of emergency set up by the putsch leaders
 retribution for yeltsin yeltsin seemed to take extraordinary relish in this shakespearean drama of betrayal and retribution
it had been gorbachev who ordered yeltsin out of a hospital bed in  to face a vengeful meeting of the moscow communist party committee
at that session one speaker after another attacked yeltsin for political immaturity and other sins for daring to criticize the party and its politburo
although this seemingly endless political saga of two reformers who can only struggle to find a common language seemed at an end this spring when they began negotiations on a new union treaty it is clear that their relationship will likely remain the great floating opera of soviet politics
 if one or another gets in the situation when he cannot even give orders like what happened now his rights and responsibilities are automatically taken by the other gorbachev said
gorbachev said the leaders of the junta tried to turn us all into chopped meat and they should be prosecuted without hesitation or forgiveness
 soviet prime minister valetin pavlov has been arrested for helping to lead the coup soviet and russian television reported today
 pavlov was one of the eight officials in the committee that ousted gorbachev from power but he was reportedly taken ill on sunday night when the coup began
according to yeltsin supreme soviet chairman anatoly lukyanov has been ousted for taking part in the coup but that has not been confirmed
 a leading conservative journalist alexander prokhanov known as the nightingale of the general staff published a transcript of his conversation with the head of the general staff academy the commanderinchief of the soviet navy and gorbachevs deputy at the defense council oleg baklanov
with remarkable candor baklanov called for a military takeover as an appropriate step to avert reforms that would result in a fundamental transformation of the union
 to some  an admitted minority  the thought of a gorbachev conspiracy is comfortably within the range of the traditional soviet art of deception known as maskirovka
and to laymen something that odd could make sense in a country where illness can mean anything from the flu to a precipitous fall from power
 the most volatile fuel for the conspiracy theory came directly from gorbachev himself in his thursday news conference in which he described his three days under house arrest in the crimea
 among the questions if gorbachevs  armed guards remained loyal to him throughout why was there no conflict with the opposition delegation that notified the president of the coup
 if gorbachevs contact with the outside world was limited to intercepting western radio outlets on an ancient shortwave radio how was he able to describe the news conference given by the collaborators down to his view of their trembling hands
 it is highly unlikely that the hardliners had been set up or ordered by gorbachev to launch a hopeless coup attempt in order to improve his political standing
 a more plausible scenario is that gorbachev was initially a full member of the conspiracy which with his participation could have clung to the fig leaf of constitutionality and would have thwarted the new union treaty to have been signed last tuesday which provided for transfer of key levers of power from the federal presidency to the leaders of republics
 it is possible that unwilling to take a huge risk and openly side with the hardliners at the start of the coup gorbachev had decided to become ill and wait out the initial phase under virtually selfimposed confinement in his summer residence
one was head of the kgb department responsible for the security of soviet leaders the other was v boldin gorbachevs closest aide by the presidents own admission a man of absolute loyalty to him
one cant help but wonder whether these two visitors came to deliver an ultimatum to gorbachev and put him under arrest in the event of his noncompliance or to deliver important documents from fellow junta members at the outset of their joint enterprise
 conspiracy theorists grope for motives  gorbachev wanted to ferret out disloyal elements in his government to make himself a hero and to delay the scheduled signing of a treaty that would have lessened his powers
gorbachev put into power the very hardliners who fronted the coup and kept them in power despite their vocal mutterings about him
john lennon spent much of a threeyear span tucked away in his room sleeping or sitting in a lotus position with his head enveloped in tobacco or marijuana smoke according to a biography of the slain beatle
an excerpt from the book the lives of john lennon by journalist and biographer albert goldman appearing in the aug  issue of people magazine discloses a sometimes unflattering portrait of both lennon and his second wife yoko ono
apart from a few hours in the morning and evening including time spent with his son sean lennon is back here in his room alone and silent
the author says the idolized beatle spent most of his adult life as an anorexic starving himself to what he perceived as perfection
the onset of the eating disorder can be traced to  goldman writes when some fool described him in print as the fat beatle
lennon rarely wore clothing other than a pair of backless slippers and avoided touching anyone according to the book
goldman spent more than six years researching the book interviewing  friends relatives and associates of lennon who was murdered eight years ago in new york
a biography that portrays john lennon as a drugaddled anorexic bisexual who raged his way from liverpool to new york city is totally fiction yoko ono said in a national radio broadcast
its a very dramatically described something but its not about john ono said wednesday night in her first broadcast comments on the book by albert goldman
the usually reclusive ono agreed to the interview to counter goldmans the lives of john lennon which presents the exbeatle as a violent drugaddicted drunk who wanted to dump his wife
goldman also charges she was responsible for paul mccartneys  marijuana bust in japan had affairs while they were married and was just as intent on a divorce as lennon
ono refuted virtually all of these charges and countered through taped interviews with lennon friends and employees that goldmans book was based on unreliable sources and misquotes
its totally fiction yoko said during the hourlong program which opened with lennons song gimme some truth and coincided with the books national release wednesday
the ono interview was taped aug  at the dakota where the lennons lived  and yoko still lives with their son sean
the interview was broadcast nationwide via the westwood one network spokeswoman laurie wilde said an exact figure on how many stations picked up the broadcast was not available
ono was interviewed by longtime associate elliot mintz who is described in goldmans book as a spy for yoko  a charge mintz denied during the show
the whole thing is just sickening said julian who also refuted goldmans tales of lennon as a violent father
she denied that lennon was homosexual that he was using drugs while living at the dakota with his son sean that he had become a reclusive rock n roll howard hughes
the book has already drawn angry responses from friends of lennon and ono mccartney who contradicted one anecdote involving lennon smashing a painting in pauls home has urged a boycott of the book
after yokos rebuttal listeners were invited to dial digit telephone numbers to vote on whether the book was an accurate portrayal of the lennons life
goldman who conducted more than  interviews for his lennon book has written controversial biographies of comedian lenny bruce and elvis presley
when celebrity biographer albert goldman began digging into the lives of john lennon his first move was to mail a long reverential request for help to yoko ono
expecting the best goldman claims to have uncovered the worst a volatile debauched lennon who evolved into the howard hughes of rock n roll tucked in his dakota bed for days at a time
that vision of the exbeatle has infuriated lennon supporters family and friends and prompted charges of fiction writing it also taught goldman  who says he is a john lennon fan  a hard lesson
goldman whose past tellall biographies dealt with elvis presley and lenny bruce remains unmoved by the hue and cry from the music industry from ono and from lennons beatle buddy paul mccartney
theyre bad for pauls business bad for yokos business back for the jive myth of rock business
goldman also rejected the complaint raised by ono mccartney julian lennon and others that lennon is an easy target to defame because hes no longer around to answer the allegations
those attacks dont really bother him unless they come from someone who hasnt read the lives of john lennon goldman said
she labeled goldmans version of life with the lennons totally fiction and brought out lennons sons julian and yearold sean to refute the biography
these giant promotions of yoko are presented as honest documentaries when theyre inhouse documentaries said goldman who complimented ono on a wellprepared show
as for the sensational charges of bisexuality drug abuse by yoko and john wild drinking binges anorexia and reclusiveness goldman says it all fits together with the image of lennon presented by those who knew him
cynthia lennon joins the throng denouncing the new unauthorized biography of her late former husband john lennon as written by a moneyhungry author capitalizing on untruths
people who write books like this it is for greed and as far as im concerned theyre gravediggers no more no less mrs lennon says on the cbs show  minutes scheduled for broadcast sunday evening
the biography by albert goldman the lives of john lennon depicts the former beatle as an anorexic bisexual addled by drugs who raged his way from liverpool to new york
goldman who defends his lennon book and said it is based on  interviews also has written controversial biographies of comedian lenny bruce and elvis presley
lennon was murdered outside his upper west side home on dec   by mark david chapman
all i know and all the people that love john know that we had our years and that nobody no film no book will ever complete what went on in our lives
ms ono already has trashed the book calling it totally fiction in a nationwide broadcast that coincided with the release of the book
cynthia and johns son julian lennon also denounced the book on the radio taping calling it lies untruths and adding that the whole thing is just sickening
sean lennon the son of yoko and john who is now  added his voice on the cbs broadcast rebutting charges that his father was inattentive to parenting
watching the new movie imagine john lennon was very painful for the late beatles wife yoko ono
the only reason why i did watch it to the end is because im responsible for it even though somebody else made it she said
andrew solt this is elvis directed solt and david l wolper produced and solt and sam egan wrote it
there is a soundtrack album and a coffeetable book with comments primarily by lennon tied in with the film and using the same title
imagine theres no heaven its easy if you try no hell below us above us only sky imagine all the people living for today
though it fails to delve too deeply into the darker side of lennon and the beatles drug use abusive tempers manager brian epsteins death it does capture the music and the times in which lennon lived
one intriguing episode in imagine shows cartoonist al capp lil abner being antagonistic toward the lennons during their bedin when they stayed in bed for a week to publicize their concern for peace
imagine theres no countries it isnt hard to do nothing to kill or die for and no religion too imagine all the people living life in peace  you may say im a dreamer but im not the only one i hope someday youll join us and the world be as one
i think that for somebody like me because i feel that im an artist and a creative artist that it is a very strange turn of events that im known as a widow she said
i think that john promoted my work a lot in his lifetime and somehow it seems like it is a pleasure for me to sort of still work in a context of a partnership with him
when albert goldmans the lives of john lennon was published in september depicting the former beatle as riddled with vices faults and neuroses ono called it totally fiction
lennons half sister julia baird also has written a new book john lennon my brother
theres still enough footage ono said for another movie  perhaps a music or political or art film
their son sean  like his older halfbrother julian has become interested in music and started playing guitar
he is just totally involved in it listening to eric clapton jimi hendrix his dads songs  only for guitar playing i think
the image of a dour shoeless english boy and his absent carefree mother prompted julia baird and geoffrey giuliano to collaborate on a book
but the neglected urchin and his liveitup mother  who was also bairds mother  never existed the authors say
that woman laughing singing dancing saying goodbye to john and john standing there alone crying mummy mummy
thats not my brother thats not my mother thats not my childrens grandmother said baird who recently spent three weeks in the united states promoting her book a family portrait of lennon and his liverpool roots
published in north america last fall john lennon my brother was coauthored by giuliano a beatles aficionado who lives in this erie canal city about  miles north of buffalo
the result is a little of both a mishmash of anecdotes showing a moody but generally happy liverpool boy singing with his mother in a bathroom with good acoustics
baird disagrees with other biographies which say that after his father decamped and julia turned her son over to her sister mimi lennon was a grim youth who felt abandoned by his mother
baird a yearold teacher in cheshire england was born seven years after lennon to julia and her commonlaw second husband john dykins
she and her younger sister jacqui grew up with their parents amid an extended family of aunts uncles cousins  and big brother john
the book tells of the sisters getting hauled out of the bathtub when teenagers lennon paul mccartney and george harrison drop by for bathroom jam sessions with julia
it tells of an alternately thoughtless and protective brother who leaves his stepsisters at the movies for hours while he goes on a date who between songs at a beatles concert shouts for security guards to lift the dykins girls out of the front row away from screaming fans threatening to storm the stage
the book got its start after baird watched a british television special in  marking the fifth anniversary of lennons murder
giuliano  a selfproclaimed huckster convinced baird to work with him on a book which he pieced together from interviews with baird in england
giulianos text reads like oral history as if a british schoolteacher had spread the family scrapbook across the readers knees to boast about her brother the musician
after julia was killed in a traffic accident in  baird saw less and less of lennon losing contact with him for years when he and wife yoko ono moved to the united states
the end of the book describes what baird calls lennons desire to regain his lost liverpool roots when she and her stepbrother exchanged letters and phone calls during 
baird has been accused of cashing in on her stepbrother but insists she just wants to tell the familys story of lennons early years
when john died the tabloids in england were knocking on the door saying write your story name your price
also shown the door was albert goldman whose sordid biography the lives of john lennon hit bookstores about the same time as bairds book
baird who read goldmans scathing biography of elvis presley said she turned down an interview with goldman who brands lennon homosexual anorexic and possibly a murderer
i had heard goldman was doing the book six years ago and i knew what the tone would be baird said
the covers lookalike photos of baird and lennon in granny specs also help but she said she didnt don them to sell books
theyre on the national health britains medical plan and she and lennon inherited their mothers shortsightedness baird said
thousands of john lennon fans some too young to remember the beatles swayed and sang along with songs including his anthem imagine at a hometown tribute

jeff pollack head of the californiabased pollack media group proposed the idea to ono who gave it the goahead
she believes recent events around the world  in germany eastern europe and particularly the middle east  show the importance of lennons peace message
lennon was born oct   and helped lead the beatles to international stardom along with comembers paul mccartney george harrison and ringo starr

none of the other beatles were at the united nations but a tribute came from lennons old songwriting partner paul mccartney who released a live version of the beatles tune birthday
the song originally on the white album was the first lennonmccartney single released since the beatles broke up in 
the release date and johns birthday is just a happy coincidence but its also a nod and a wink to my old mate said mccartney 
in lennons hometown in england fans gathered at the former site of the cavern club where the beatles were discovered

the mug is one of an assortment of lennon collectibles available by appointment only from bag one arts inc the entity that controls reproductions of lennons art work
some of that black on white artwork  which includes doodles jotted down on napkins the margins of letters or stray scraps of paper  has been colorized or redone in neon at onos order
people would ask if we had anything in color says lynne clifford who runs bag one for yoko

although bag ones gallery a few blocks from the dakota deals primarily in lithographs it also sells the collectibles including  laminated bags that bear lennons drawings
the foundation established by lennon and ono before johns death has contributed to causes ranging from a home for drug addicted children to bulletproof vests for police officers
drummer andy newmark was touring with roxy music in the summer of  when he got the call that changed his life he was to play on john lennons new album
lennon had been in virtual seclusion for five years busy taking care of his son sean and admittedly out of songwriting ideas
but in  he suddenly felt inspired again and planned to return to the studio to make an album with his wife yoko ono
rare photos occasionally emerged and he looked different in each one lennon jokingly referred to himself as greta hughes and howard garbo
producer jack douglas who had worked with lennon as an engineer recruited newmark bassist tony levin guitarist hugh mccracken and other new yorkbased sessions players
his personality seemed so consistent with all we had ever heard about john lennon said newmark who still lives in new york and works with former roxy music singer bryan ferry
newmark spent just one month in the studio playing on the songs that eventually ended up on double fantasy and milk and honey lennons final albums
lennon defended his selfimposed retirement on watching the wheels and summed up his feelings about turning  on borrowed time capping the line good to be older with a selfassured you bet
reunions were out of the question a return to adolescence in his opinion but talking about the old days seemed the nicest kind of high
by the fall newmark had finished working on the album and his contact with lennon was limited to an occasional visit to the studio
milk and honey was to come out the following year and lennon wanted to tour using many of the same musicians
it took the drummer a long time to recover from lennons murder the night of dec   he didnt even feel like working for the next few years  everything else suddenly seemed second rate
when he thinks about it now its not so much a particular song that hurts him its the daytoday stuff the jokes and wisecracks the coffee and the stories
when i looked in his eyes i felt a tremendous depth of character and a tremendous understanding of the human condition a tremendous amount of compassion newmark said
dozens of fans of rock legend and former beatle john lennon gathered in the snow on a windy saturday for a ceremony marking the th anniversary of his death
liverpools mayor dorothy gavin led lennon devotees who laid wreaths at the foot of a bronze statue of the beatles in the citys cavern walks shopping center
the center was built on the original site of the cavern club made famous when the beatles played there in the s and has become a place of pilgrimage
give peace a chance the title of one of singersongwriter lennons greatest hits was the theme for the day
many friends and followers of lennon were present including father tom mckenzie immortalized as father mackenzie in the beatles l hit song eleanor rigby
on friday a small group of invited guests had gathered at liverpools beatles museum to watch mrs gavin unveil a plaque marking the th anniversary of lennons death
john was always a son of liverpool and over the last  years liverpool has been very slow to recognize the fact that the beatles came from liverpool said lennon biographer ray coleman after the unveiling
it is right that a world figure like lennon should be recognized at last said coleman author of john lennon
lennon and his wife yoko ono were returning to their apartment in new yorks dakota apartment building after a recording session on dec   when lennon was shot to death by mark david chapman a deranged fan to whom lennon had given his autograph only hours before
a spokesman for the lennon family said ms ono and the couples son sean were in europe and would spend the anniversary privately
journalist andy peebles the last person to interview lennon before he was shot said in an interview with sky satellitetelevision news ten years on its a ghastly feeling to think that you had spent  seven hours  with somebody you have been a fan of for years and i think i left  thinking this is great hes in really good shape
peebles said late in  that lennon had just recovered from a period when he had gone off the rails and his relationship with ms ono had suffered
 well lets see theres party rockers the bs and cult singer lene lovich  successful critically acclaimed musicians who credit onos music as an influence
theres the whitney museum of art which exhibited onos artwork last year  one of the  museum shows she has had around the world
 theres also the american film institute which ono says is staging an international tour of her experimental films
and onos record label  they want to put out all my songs in a kind of cd box or something ono says
 im used to sort of knocking the door rather than having the door opened and having to cope with entering it ono says during a telephone interview
 shes speaking from the new york office of bag one arts the company ono founded to promote lennons art and image
 marketing an icon since his death in  ono has steadily kept lennon products coming out the albums milk and honey and menlove avenue and the cd boxed set the john lennon collection the book skywriting by word of mouth a collection of lennons unpublished writings lennons art which ono says was his main interest in his final years and lennoninspired merchandise such as a line of john lennon eyeglasses
she began doing performance art in the early s long before the form was legitimized by art critics and government grants
 ono still lives in the dakota apartment house in new york the site of lennons murder by a crazed fan
 on dec   the couple was returning home from the recording studio where they had been remixing walking on thin ice one of the songs that would appear on onos most successful album season of glass
 ono was born in tokyo  her name means ocean child  and came with her family to the united states in 
ono lived with her family in san francisco and new york until the japanese attack of pearl harbor forced them to return home
 others say lennon used his relationship with ono as an escape from things in his life that he felt were controlling him  such as the beatles
 in may  when the beatles came together at the studio to work on the beatles the tworecord set commonly called the white album ono was at lennons side
according to at least one beatles biographer ono even accompanied lennon on trips to the bathroom
 still the group already seemed headed toward a breakup which finally came when mccartney sued the other beatles to resolve an argument over the groups management
theyre not doing anything like creating a nuclear bomb or trying to decide whether people should be killed
 many of the books that have been written about lennon and the beatles especially albert goldmans loathing portrait of lennon have been painful to ono
say what you want about albert goldman the author of the new biography the lives of john lennon morrow  but youve got to hand it to him this guy is one ambitious sleazemonger
most bestselling pop biographers play it safe they choose a celeb of respectable not to say pristine reputation and then they proceed to blacken it preferably by recounting vaguely sourced tales of sexual excess chemical dependency personal unkindness raw business dealings even in some cases dyslexia
the resulting portrait of a dissipated ogre who cant spell is duly presented in hardback form to the public which in turn is so shocked and disgusted that it forces itself to buy the biography by the millions
now mr presley was if youll forgive the expression a fat target for a writer of mr goldmans methods
his title notwithstanding the king of rock n roll was in truth more a creature of the old show biz a star whose wholesome image carefully created by pr
but in choosing mr lennon as his next target mr goldman appears to be trying to debunk the undebunkable
for apart from his puerile politics mr lennons favorite topic in the thousands of interviews he gave was his own squalid history his voracious drug use his perfidy to employees his unquenchable sexual promiscuity and so on
the leitmotif of mr lennons confessions was that his worst days were behind him and that with yoko ono he had at last learned to prize the virtues of quietude and domesticity
hence this page stew of unrelieved sordidness percolating with the scoops that have by now been widely publicized in people magazine west th and other scholarly venues that mr lennon had a thing for young boys that his marriage to ms ono was pocked by the same faithlessness and rancor that characterized his first marriage that he had a sweet tooth that just wouldnt quit
remarkably then the sleazemongers art has triumphed mr goldmans john lennon is even worse than john lennons john lennon
a great deal of this muck manages to splash onto ms ono whom mr goldman portrays as a cynical manipulator whose major talent lay in exploiting mr lennon to further her own craving for fame and wealth
mr goldman alas allows to pass unremarked the obvious irony that this is a rather fine thumbnail sketch of himself as well
ms ono and her son have taken the path preferred by offended celebrities they have hit the talk shows to display their wounds
and rolling stone magazine long the house organ for the lennon publicity machine recently published an extensive rebuttal to the book which was undercut by a tone of priggish indignation bordering on the comic
criticizing the lives of john lennon for insufficient respect to the fallen beatles legacy is rather off the point  like condemning charles manson for his bad table manners
but one can only hope that quibbles about its veracity do not obscure the countless other reasons to hate mr goldmans book
there is for starters the sloppy pompous prose so suggestive of the gradschool smoking lounge  mr goldman is the sort of writer who refers to pop songs as pieces as though they were concerti
there is his knowing hipperthanthou approach  toward drugs sex music  that gives him license to secondguess mr lennons every move
and there is the awkward organization in which minor events assume large proportions for the simple reason that they reflect badly on mr lennon while major events are skipped over lightly because  there goes the advance
all of which indicates why the lives of john lennon is such a wretched book not because it makes a good man look bad but because it shows no other purpose than to make a man  whether a good man or a bad one we laymen will probably never know  look bad

an antiamerican newspaper in iran said sunday the united states is partly to blame for the death of tens of thousands of people in last weeks earthquake
the criminal role of america in irans past became evident once again in the recent earthquake the jomhuri islami said in an editorial reported by the official islamic republic news agency
our people even under the rubble chant death to america and pray to god to cut off the hands of the united states  even those hands stretched out to help it said
it argued that by plundering irans oil and other resources for  years the united states had prevented the use of even a small part of the national wealth for urban development projects and advanced antiseismic building construction systems
even after its expulsion from iran the us government by imposing economic sanctions and launching several other plots halted the renovation of the country the editorial added
the newspaper was implying that with these actions the united states had blocked the diversion of funds to earthquake safety measures

since last weeks surgery fans had flooded the hospital with thousands of getwell cards sent via telegram and even facsimile machine
miss ball was a toughtalking woman who had used her stardom and show business savvy to become with her thenhusband the late desi arnaz head of one of hollywoods major studios desilu
from her starstruck childhood through her struggles as a wisecracking movie actress in the s and s to the television career that made her a legend miss balls life was in the best show business tradition of rags to riches
almost humbly she liked to say she owed her enormous success not so much to talent but to a magical combination of guts and good supporting players
her greatest achievements she always would add were not any milestones in her career but ranked somewhere under the birth of her two children lucie in  and desi jr two years later
it was i love lucy which premiered on cbs on oct   that earned miss ball her niche in television history
the minute comedy starred miss ball and the cubanborn arnaz as the wacky lucy ricardo and her congaplaying husband ricky
the show was a weekly dash into absurdity that boasted the biggest television audience of its time  of almost any time
stopped the nation in creating the show miss ball and arnaz  who died in   set a pattern of television that was to be repeated in decades to come
in fact nighttime shoppers became so scarce in chicago that the mammoth marshall field department store posted a sign that read we love lucy too so from now on we will be open thursday night instead of monday
when presidential candidate adlai e stevenson interrupted the show once for a political message he was flooded with angry mail
even a charge that miss ball was a communist made by the house unamerican activities committee in  failed to dent her popularity
the charges based on her registering to vote as a communist in  were dropped when miss ball explained she had done so only to please her ailing grandfather
a phenomenal  million viewers watched the antics each week as lucy would always try to outwit ricky
with their best friends and landlords fred and ethel mertz played by veterans william frawley and vivian vance as the perfect foils the ricardos found themselves mired in situations that frequently were rowdy and always ridiculous
a generation of americans grew to recap their favorite lucy episodes plot twist by crazy twist
there was the time lucy schemed her way onto rickys television show to do a commercial for a vegetable drink with a high alcoholic content and got hilariously tipsy during the many retakes
then there was the time she threw in two packages of yeast while baking homemade bread and ended up pinned against the wall of her manhattan kitchen by a monster loaf
and there was the time lucy and ethel trying to impress their new york friends with the ultimate souvenir from a trip to hollywood pried loose the cement block containing john waynes footprints from in front of graumans chinese theater
week after week lucy would find herself trapped in a vat of laundry starch locked in a meat freezer or lost on a subway with a loving cup stuck on her head
an extraordinary discipline and intuitive understanding of farce give i love lucy an engaging lilt wrote new york times critic jack gould
tricked out as a ballerina or a hindu maharani or a toothless hillbilly she takes her assorted lumps and pratfalls with unflagging zest and good humor
she was always in financial trouble  if she wanted a fur collar a ratty little fur collar she had to figure out a way to make some extra money to get it
miss balls personal favorite episodes were filmed when she was pregnant with desi jr an amazing  million viewers  of the television audience gleefully watched on jan   when she gave birth on film to the shows little ricky
i was so damned happy  just floating on a cloud  and i think the way i felt came across on the film she said
astoundingly or so it seems in retrospect early reviews of miss balls talents gave little hint of what was to come
in fact when she was a plucky yearold looking for that first break on broadway miss ball was told by a drama teacher to give up
born to an electrician father and pianist mother on aug   in a suburb of jamestown ny miss ball had set her sights on stardom almost from the first
each spring that followed she would head toward new york city walking until someone found her and returned her to her home
leaving school at  miss ball finally made it to new york and the john murray anderson dramatic school
there was a brief stint in a ziegfeld follies road show and some shortlived appearances in a handful of broadway chorus lines
changing her name to diane belmont i always loved the name diane and i was driving past the belmont race track and the names seemed to fit together she turned to modeling
at various times a dress model and a hat model miss ball with long legs peeking out the bottom of a oversized cigarette pack ultimately became a chesterfield girl
her curly hair bleached a jean harlow platinum miss ball was hired to work for six weeks in the chorus of samuel goldwyns roman scandals
bit part after bit part stretched her stay to six months and she became a hollywood fixture taking second billing in the years that followed to everyone from the three stooges and buster keaton to katharine hepburn and spencer tracy
along the way she dyed her hair a fiery red and was given the unofficial title of queen of the bs
playing the ingenue lead in the  musical too many girls miss ball met rumba singer arnaz cast as a cuban football player
with arnaz traveling the country with his band and miss ball committed to hollywood sound stages the pair spent almost  on telegrams and longdistance telephone calls
since cbs was stubbornly opposed to the idea of the heavily accented arnaz playing the husband the determined arnazes created their own desilu company and took a stage version of their show on the road to gauge public opinion
the episodes were filmed before a live audience by academy awardwinning cinematographer karl freund famous for his work on such films as the good earth and garbos camille
when the arnazes negotiated to keep the films to show our kids someday few in the industry predicted what would happen
i remember someone saying these films may be worth something someday  miss ball told the times
all i knew was i was  years old and was having my first baby and i didnt want to do these shows and let them disappear into the air
instead in the years since the original  i love lucy episodes were telecast they have been shown and reshown in virtually every country around the globe earning an estimated  million to  million
breaking with the past miss ball left hollywood for new york and a starring role in the musical wildcat
meanwhile arnaz and miss ball had sold their i love lucy films to cbs for  million and she bought her exhusbands interest in desilu becoming in effect the first woman to head a major studio
i never wanted to be an executive but when my marriage to desi broke up after  years i couldnt just walk away from my obligations and say forget it  miss ball explained
when she was running desilu he said she made decisions affecting the future of the company that often amazed board members not because they were coming from a woman but because time usually proved her judgment to be correct
among the shows miss ball tutored to success was her own the lucy show a series without arnaz but with the same madcap clowning that kept her fans delighted
among the guest stars attracted by the madness were elizabeth taylor and richard burton the most glittering couple of the day
in  with desilu churning out a gold mine of televisions hits star trek and mission impossible among them an exhausted miss ball decided that she had had enough
in place of desilu miss ball along with morton launched the much smaller lucille ball productions inc and in  began filming heres lucy a series featuring desi jr and lucie
although by now the worlds bestknown television star as a movie star miss ball again received mixed reviews
times critic charles champlin wrote the shame about mame is that it managed to deny us a lucy to love
with those final starring credits to her name she settled into coproducing shows making occasional television appearances and accepting one after another of a continual barrage of awards and tributes
in addition to her  emmy nominations she won four miss ball was feted in  with a nostalgic television tribute saluting the th anniversary of i love lucy
calling lucille ball just a comedienne is like calling margot fonteyn just a dancer kaye said
in  when she was named one of seven initial inductees in the television hall of fame she credited the many talented and creative people around her for making her a legend
role as bag lady the following year she took on one of the most challenging roles of her career a bag lady in the television movie stone pillow
her last flirtation with television came with her illfated and shortlived  series life with lucy in which she again teamed with longtime sidekick gale gordon
her final public appearance proved to be during the st annual academy awards ceremony on march  when she joined her old friend hope as a presenter
tearfully sentimental when it came to her husband and family she reveled in life as a grandmother and glowed whenever she talked of her children
while she always spoke fondly of arnaz miss ball claimed that she had found the perfect mate in morton
but to her countless television fans  from the postwar babies who adored her during the s to their children and childrens children who roared at her antics through decades of reruns  it was always lucy and ricky
there was always the hilarious image of the redhead and that cuban bongo player as miss ball affectionately called him

reagans successor extended his deepest sympathy to miss balls family and called her a legendary figure
her copresenter was bob hope who a few hours after her death said simply god has her now but thanks to television well have her forever
the scene on north roxbury drive in beverly hills where miss ball spent her last and what she said were her happiest years was one of curiousity coupled with genuine mourning
about  people gathered on the sidewalk some snapping photographs of the home and of the dozen television crews standing outside
andy stern a neighbor said that the large white house surrounded by snapdragons and bougainvillea was the most popular of all the homes on the hollywood stars tours they the buses stop at her house more than any other
another neighbor bob rosati said he was watching a rerun of i love lucy when the screen went black and the words in memory of lucille ball  appeared
karen pope who described herself as an aspiring actress drove from her los angeles home with a little container of flowers and a sign that read lucy is seen in the smile of everyones eyes
she left them with a guard at miss balls home turned away and said quietly shes touched all of us
many of the people outside the house were like karen mestichelli from philadelphia a tourist who had purchased a map to the neighborhoods where many of the entertainment greats live
in paris entertainer sammy davis jr called miss ball a great artist  one of the worlds greatest clowns
comedian george burns another friend of many years said as long as the world goes on lucy will be seen
television and film actor danny devito recalled getting a personal congratulation from miss ball in  when he won an emmy for his work on the tv series taxi
to baby boomers a happy chunk of our childhood is missing said saturday night live comedian victoria jackson who was born two years after the i love lucy show went off the air as a regular series
from william s paley chairman of cbs inc where i loved lucy reigned for all those years lucille ball will always be the first lady of cbs
a bouquet of red roses had been left in front of the centers north tower and calls were coming in from all over the world
maureen lamour a hospital admittance representative said she heard the news of miss balls death on her way to work
we the staff always kept in touch with how she was doing and kept up with all the gifts and cards she received because it was like they were for a family member she said
lucille ball whose death wednesday morning at the age of  will be the most widely and deeply felt showbusiness loss in recent memory was the movies greatest gift to television
it turned out to be one of sam goldwyns finest and most prophetic hours when he signed her as one of his goldwyn girls to appear in roman scandals with eddie cantor in 
she had had bit parts in two earlier films but roman scandals was the one that gave her a firmer foothold on the slippery slopes of a hollywood career
she perfected her matchless craft as a comedienne in dozens of films including three of fred astaires and one of the marx brothers room service
but in those years lucy was refining her enduring endearing public image as a perky saucy woman who was likelier at least in the early days to end up with the heros funny pal than with the hero himself
yet as often happened with supporting performers her verve an engagingly sharp tongue and a rather salty view of the world made her more interesting than the squarecut principals and led to leading roles
today many sitcoms still use the threecamera technique shooting in front of live audiences that desi arnaz pioneered
the idea now seems as inevitable as the wheel or presliced muffins and yet you wonder if it would have worked nearly as well or caught on at all without lucys sheer expertise as a physical as well as a verbal comedienne
she made it all  even the wildest craziest capers  look as if it were happening now  spontaneous unrehearsed accidental the inevitable consequences of the screen lucys scatterbrained and lovable personality
her foils  desi himself vivian vance and william frawley  were superb farceurs themselves but lucy was the dynamo that made it all work
it was a brilliant illusion generating a charm that hid the hard work and the artful writing and editing as well as the performing
the result was probably the finest and certainly the most durable single series in televisions history thus far
yet they have been embraced as the kind of middleclass goingson that might possibly arise almost anywhere there is a middle class
her successful career in films in which she ultimately earned star billing if not superstar status gave her an invaluable identification when i love lucy began
indeed when lucy began to commandeer our hearts on i love lucy in  the movies were already in considerable trouble their audiences staying home in large numbers to watch the likes of lucy in their living rooms
then again the cameras television or film have xray properties and the millions who saw and loved her were not wrong to think they perceived a generous and loving woman as well as a glorious clown who knew the world was better off laughing
mikhail s gorbachev on friday proposed tougher legislation to punish soviets who seek to kindle ethnic unrest saying nationalist passions benefit opponents of his reforms
the soviet leader told a meeting of the communist party leadership that interethnic relations were worsening in some regions of the country due in part to active resistance put up to perestroika by corrupt groups
staterun media also indicated friday that a crackdown had begun on people in armenia who continue to agitate for annexation of a mostly armenian enclave in the neighboring republic of azerbaijan
the sixmonth conflict between the two republics over control of the nagornokarabakh district has led to mass rallies strikes and ethnic violence since february
the conflict over nagornokarabakh is one of the most rancorous domestic disputes faced by gorbachev since he became communist party chief in march 
he indicated friday he wants to defuse tensions between ethnic groups but also to punish those who transform the tensions into a political crisis
gorbachev outlined the reasons for a current aggravation of tensions between ethnic groups in some regions of the soviet union tass said
among the causes gorbachev listed a lack of concern for many years for the specific requirements of peoples and ethnic groups inadequate control by the masses over the activities of executive personnel and active resistance put up to perestroika by corrupt groups
tass said that after gorbachev noted that nationalist passions benefit all antiperestroika forces he suggested increasing accountability in soviet laws for kindling ethnic strife
at the july  presidium meeting the soviet leader accused corrupt conservatives who oppose his reforms of hiding behind the nagornokarabakh annexation drive
gorbachev said the grounds for tougher legislation come directly from article  of the  soviet constitution which says the law can punish any advocacy of racial or national exclusiveness hostility or contempt
tass said gorbachev made other proposals on how to resolve ethnic tensions including an increase in power for each of the countrys  republics a law on equal use of the more than  languages spoken in the soviet union and some economic autonomy for the countrys republics and regions
in particular the baltic republics of lithuania latvia and estonia forcibly incorporated into the soviet union in  have demanded more say in their own economic and government affairs
the labor newspaper trud said  people in yerevan armenias capital will face criminal charges following an incident in which activists seeking the annexation of nagornokarabakh attached slogans to their cars and drove around the city
the paper did not give the date or size of the mobile demonstration but said  drivers have had their licenses revoked and  were fined
in its july th decision the presidium also ordered local law enforcement agencies to ensure order was restored in the caucasus mountain region
tass reported friday that the situation was stabilizing in armenia but said that at the urging of instigators some strikes and protests were continuing
the government has decided to give ethnic germans and crimean tatars who were expelled from their homelands by josef stalin their own autonomous regions but it will take years tass reported wednesday
were working on creating such autonomy said rafik nishanov chairman of a chamber of the soviet legislature in remarks carried by the official news agency
the tatars of the crimea and the ethnic germans who lived on the volga river were forcibly resettled during world war ii when josef stalin kicked peoples out of their homelands on the grounds they could not be trusted to occupy strategic areas
the tatars and germans among others long have been agitating to return from siberia and central asia to their traditional lands and last month the supreme soviet legislature declared that all peoples exiled under stalin should be considered politically rehabilitated
but other people now occupy the lands and houses that belonged to the exiles and reestablishing their dominion in their home regions will not be so simple
the supreme soviet took the basic decision that the two autonmous regions should be created on nov  but kept it quiet apparently fearing explosive reactions from the populations now living in the regions
it was also a potentially dangerous precedent the soviet union is a patchwork of well over  ethnic groups and many of them have outstanding territorial claims
residents of the saratov and volgograd regions have protested the prospect of seeing many of the nations estimated  million germans descending on them
their protests near the kremlin in  demanding to be allowed to return to their homeland were among the first tests of president mikhail s gorbachevs promises of greater democracy
several thousand tatars have been filtering back to the crimea each year despite the lack of wholesale permission to return
a wave of some  ethnic germans emigrated to west germany this year but many would probably stay if they could be assured of their own republic said irina ostroukh a researcher at the soviet institute of ethnography who studies ethnic germans
the nov  plan approved by the supreme soviet recommended excluding from the german region areas where resistance to german resettlement was strongest in order to avoid ethnic conflicts
the explosive conflict between armenians and azerbaijanis over the nagornokarabakh region has led to  deaths and hundreds of thousands of refugees in the last two years
the supreme soviet charged the government with creating a commmission to determine how to create the regions for the germans and crimean tatars
ethnic violence killed  people and wounded  this month in the central asian republic of kirghizia the official news agency tass said wednesday
tass said  of the injured had to be hospitalized and said a search was continuing for a police officer who vanished june 
no new outbreaks were reported in the region near the border city of osh in western kirghizia where clashes arising from a land dispute began on june  between ethnic kirghiz and uzbeks both sunni moslems
maj gen alexander grienko chief of the interior ministrys political department said that in two years of civil strife  mainly ethnic clashes  in the soviet union about  people have been arrested
he said in moscow on tuesday that ministry troops had to be used in  regions of the soviet union because of such outbreaks tass said
the general was quoted as saying these conflicts were often accompanied by riots and pogroms arson and massacre of innocent people and complete or partial destabilization of the situation
besides unrest this month in kirghizia and uzbekistan ethnic violence also has been reported in recent years in georgia armenia azerbaijan kazakhstan and tadzhikistan
moldavia acting to defuse one of the soviet unions most explosive ethnic conflicts agreed sunday to comply with a kremlin order to reconsider its law making moldavian the republics official language
the republics parliament acted in response to a decree issued on dec  by president mikhail s gorbachev the official news agency tass reported
gorbachev also gave the republic  days to dissolve a new national guard and to come up with measures guaranteeing equal rights for all ethnic groups within its borders
tass said the moldavan parliament agreed to disband the nationalguard and to revise a law that gorbachev said restricted the rights of minorities
ethnic tension has gripped moldavia a largely agricultural republic bordering romania during its push for independence from the soviet union this year
the unrest turned violent last month when government troops clashed with activists leaving four dead
gorbachev said the conflicts had reached critical levels and he put part of the blame on the moldavian supreme soviet for enacting laws that discriminate against minorities
alarmed by rising moldavian nationalism two of the republics minority groups have begun their own separatist movements
in the eastern part of moldavia more than  ethnic russians and ukrainians have joined in declaring a new republic along the dneister river
in particular they resent a new law making moldavian the official language and requiring people in dozens of jobs ranging from doctors to hairdressers to pass moldavian language tests by 
soviet hardliners want gorbachev to impose a state of emergency and presidential rule in troubled zones throughout the ethnically and geographically diverse country
gorbachev said the declaration of the gagauz and dniester republics was illegal under the soviet and moldavian constitutions as were elections to form legislatures and any actions by those bodies
after residents of the gagauz region began holding local elections in late october the moldavian legislature clamped a twomonth state of emergency on the region restricting movement in and out of the area and banning public rallies
volunteer brigades of collegeage moldavians who then flocked to the region to try to stop the separatist movement were ordered dissolved by gorbachevs decree
viktor alksnis former ussr supreme soviet deputy today reminded us of his existence
correspondent irina zaytseva viktor alksnis born  latvian former deputy of the supreme soviet of the former ussr soldier resigned from the army in order to fight for the restoration of the ussr
he began it with a short statement the essence of which comes down to the fact that the adoption of the latvian citizenship law violates not only human rights but creates the conditions for a conflict similar in his opinion to the ones in yugoslavia and the caucasus
according to him during the latest visit to the united states by latvian president guntis ulmanis sanction was obtained for the adoption of the aforementioned discriminatory law
begin alksnis recording and thus carte blanche was given for mild ethnic cleansing of the russian speaking population of the republic
end recording zaytseva apart from that alksnis added according to information received from reliable sources certain circles in moscow want conflict in latvia
begin alksnis recording a certain scenario exists to drive a socalled security corridor along the route daugavpilsyekabpilsriga where stringent ethnic cleansing of the latvian population will take place in reply to the mild ethnic cleansing of the russian population in order to bring socalled independent latvia to its knees
end recording zaytseva journalists asked for more precise information about what alksnis called reliable sources
end recording zaytseva asked what he intends to do alksnis said his opportunities are unfortunately limited and that is why he is appealing to journalists
in his opinion only joint efforts can bring this information to the attention of world public opinion point out the seriousness of this issue and avoid the coming tragedy
bfn dushanbe  may tass  the tajik communist party has called for the restoration of a renovated soviet union in the form of a federation as the only means to ensure the development of the political economic and spiritual potential of former soviet republics
tajik communists leader shodiy shabdolov told itartass on monday  maythat the disintegration of the soviet union and the parade of sovereignty that followed it have led to economic and political chaos in all republics
radical market reforms imposed by quasi democrats and wild privatisation have enriched a small group of nouveau riches and plunged the rest of the population in poverty and hunger he said
the mass drive for sovereignty was accompanied by armed interethnic conflicts in many exsoviet republics and outburst of nationalism
over one million people about twothirds of the adult population signed appeals for unity brotherhood and friendship of the peoples of the ussr adopted by numerous conferences and meetings held all across the republic
apart from the communist party the founders of the new movement include tajik trade unions the union of tajik women organisations of veterans and ethnic and cultural associations
a ceasefire in moldova was threatened yesterday when a truck driver transporting militiamen was shot dead by machinegun fire in the selfproclaimed trans dnestr republic home of the russianspeaking minority
the shooting came shortly after the ceasefire came into effect between the moldovan authorities dominated by ethnic romanians and the minority based in the republic on the east bank of the river dnestr
in other respects however the conflicts are quite different and illustrate the complexity of conflict with which the former soviet union is now faced
the trans dnestr conflict stems directly from the breakup of the soviet union while nagornokarabakh has been a source of tension between azeris and armenians for centuries
the soviet leadership sought to stifle any attempts to preserve its former links with romania  calling moldovan a separate language from romanian and constructing a separate history for the moldovan people
industry was largely situated on the left bank of the dnestr in the sliver of the republic next to ukraine and largely staffed by russians and ukrainians
ukrainians and russians together represent some  per cent of the population with moldovans accounting for  per cent
when it did in  a language movement quickly put the hardline communist party on the defensive and it lost power in  to the present nationalist government headed by president mircea snegur the former secretary of the moldovan partys central committee
from the beginning of the nationalist movement it was clear that the russian and to a lesser extent the ukrainian minorities would be hostile reacting to laws establishing moldovan as the official language and to calls for renewed union with romania with strikes and demonstrations and finally last year proclaiming trans dnestr independent under a russian president mr igor smirnov
during the august coup last year the moldovan government stoutly rejected it and the trans dnestr authorities welcomed it siding with the soviet army in its brief efforts to impose military rule
the trans dnestr side has been augmented by cossacks from nearby areas returning to their traditional role as defenders of russias borders
the daily izvestia reported yesterday that the cossacks appear to have appointed themselves mercenaries for the russians they are paid from rbs to rbs a week by the trans dnestr authorities
troops of the former soviet union were ordered to pull out from the armenian enclave of nagornokarabakh yesterday after they were fired on during clashes between azeri and armenian militants
marshal yevgeny shaposhnikov the commonwealth of independent states defence minister announced the decision as fighting worsened in the disputed territory in spite of efforts to secure a truce
the order for the pullout of the th motorised regiment follows the deaths earlier this week of a handful of soldiers caught in the fighting between armenian guerrillas and azerbaijani forces
marshal shaposhnikov who is also commanderinchief has long warned that he would withdraw troops rather than allow them to become targets of ethnic conflicts in the former soviet union
commanders of the transcaucasus military district which encompasses georgia as well as armenia and azerbaijan have been ordered to rebuff attacks on military installations
azeri and armenian officials say sophisticated weapons including combat helicopters tanks and armoured personnel carriers are being used by guerrillas on both sides in the fouryearold conflict
armenian militants attacked the last azeri stronghold in nagornokarabakh yesterday according to azerbaijans interior ministry which said residents of the town of shusha fled as helicopter gunships swooped down from snowcovered mountains
russia and georgia yesterday deployed blue helmet troops to stop ethnic fighting in the disputed region of south ossetia in the first peacekeeping operation since the collapse of the soviet union reuter reports from moscow
reports from the remote transcaucasian region said hundreds of heavily armed russian troops from the th paratroop battalion moved into a kmwide security zone separating rebel south ossetia from the rest of georgia
georgian national guards occupied similar positions on their side of the border and pulled out all their men from the south ossetian capital of tskhinvali
but itartass news agency said gunfire overnight near the city killed four civilians and injured two others underscoring the difficulties facing the operation
the mission was the first peacekeeping attempt anywhere in the former soviet union whose disintegration last year has prompted waves of bloodletting in ethnic flashpoints from the romanian to the afghan borders
reports from the former soviet republic of moldova said several people had been killed overnight in fresh ceasefire violations between government forces and separatists
in the transcaucasian republic of armenia radio russia said five civilians had died overnight in azerbaijani shelling the latest victims of a fouryear undeclared war which has killed  people
russia and georgia were cautiously optimistic that ossetia could be the first region of the former soviet union where armed conflict could be resolved with the help of political measures and actions
south ossetia is part of georgia but wants to unite with neighbouring north ossetia which was assigned to russia by stalin
they will be joined later by a multiethnic force  russians ukrainians ossetians and other mountain peoples  under the nominal command of north ossetian leaders
the peacekeepers mission is to form a physical barrier between the two sides opening the way to future talks
the greatest threat is expected to come from hundreds of armed fighters on both sides operating independently in a dozen or so bands outside the control of either russian or georgian authorities
interfax news agency said russias vicepresident alexander rutskoi at present on a visit to moldova proposed a similar peacekeeping operation there
russia flew  special forces to halt ethnic fighting in the troubled caucasus mountains at the weekend its second troop deployment in a week to support a beleaguered government in its former empire
russian president boris yeltsin sent spetsnaz commandos and elite police to vladikavkaz capital of the russian autonomous republic of north ossetia  miles south of moscow
the troops were sent to halt fighting between ossetians and a regional ethnic group the ingush who officials claimed were setting fire to ossetianowned homes
scores were reported killed and injured in street fighting between ossetians and ingush in the past several days
ingush rebels were reported yesterday to have taken hostage  russian interior ministry soldiers based in the region
a local official said the soldiers were seized on friday in the dzhermen settlement located near the regional capital vladikavkaz and populated mostly by ingushis mr felix gutnov spokesman for the north ossetian interior ministry said
the ingush who declared an independent state in june are demanding the return of lands that russian leader josef stalin expropriated in  and declared part of north ossetia
mr yeltsin and russian prime minister yegor gaidar held emergency meetings on the crisis on saturday and yesterday
at the same time the north ossetian government said it would distribute russian armysupplied automatic weapons to civilian volunteers
the russian authorities are strong enough to make all those violating the law respect it russian deputy prime minister georgy khizha mr yeltsins specialist on the caucasus told russian television
the russian action mirrored recent developments in the former soviet republic of tajikistan where russian troops have also been deployed
the central asian nation which has yet to form its own army since the soviet union collapsed last december has also distributed weapons to civilians
on october  russian soldiers played a crucial role in crushing a coup attempt in the tajik capital of dushanbe
the caucasus mountains which stretch from southern russia to the borders of turkey and iran are engulfed by several conflicts
the international community is starting to look beyond the conflict in the former yugoslavia and is becoming increasingly aware of the true magnitude and seriousness of ethnic and political conflicts in the former soviet union
the disputes in the transcaucasus central asia and elsewhere in the former soviet union are causing great suffering for those involved
they are concerned too about the safety of ethnic russians living in those countries where there are conflicts and about the economic and social consequences of refugees fleeing to russia whose potential number is estimated at more than m
they ask why when the international community is engaged in peacemaking and peacekeeping in many of the worlds trouble spots similar efforts should not be undertaken in the hot spots near them
equally these disputes are of legitimate concern to britain its western partners and the whole international community both for humanitarian reasons and because such flashpoints risk provoking regional instability
if uncontrolled they pose a variety of threats to european security including increased traffic in drugs and arms as well as international terrorism
crises in russias newly independent neighbours may also complicate russias relations with the west unless they are carefully handled they risk prejudicing the emerging relationship between us
the british government will not underwrite russian involvement unless it is sure that peacekeeping troops will not turn into occupying forces
nor are countries that secured their independence when the soviet union was dissolved keen that the west should concede to moscow the same role it played in the soviet empire
this has meant that even though the west lacks the resources to engage directly in those trouble spots it has been wary of appearing to endorse russian involvement instead in case it had imperial tendencies
if we are to fashion a joint approach by russia and its western partners to the problem of peacekeeping in the former soviet union we must address all these concerns
if the russians want international recognition and more active support from the international community the west in turn needs guarantees that russia will not regard recognition of its involvement as giving it carte blanche in the former soviet union
peacekeeping in the former soviet union as indeed peacekeeping elsewhere must comply with internationally recognised principles
we agreed that the principles underlying russian cis or international peacekeeping operations would need to include strict respect for the sovereignty of the countries involved an invitation from the government concerned and the consent of the parties to the conflict commitment to a parallel political peace process a clear mandate setting out the role of the peacekeeping forces which should whenever possible be multinational in character and an exit strategy for the peacekeeping forces deployed
these principles should help stimulate a dialogue and political settlement between the parties to the conflict focus attention and where possible resources on the settlement of conflicts in the former soviet union
although the conference for security and cooperation in europe and the un lack the resources to put large numbers of peacekeepers on the ground themselves they may be able to suggest measures to enhance transparency and to monitor the peace process
extending cooperation within the north atlantic cooperation council and also cooperation between russia and nato might help improve training for russian peacekeepers
one of the ways in which we can help prevent conflicts is to strengthen the democratic institutions in the newly independent countries of the former soviet union
the csce and other international institutions can play an important role here drawing the newly independent countries into a more active dialogue on ways of promoting democratic values and principles
we discussed ways of strengthening the csces role including the role of the high commissioner for national minorities at the recent rome ministerial meeting
potentially explosive cocktails of ethnic and political animosities could spread the fire of intolerance all too easily to other countries and regions
our security is indivisible and we must ensure it by vigorous and imaginative efforts aimed at promoting peace for all as well as rights for all
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev warned the nation saturday night that the countrys growing ethnic strife is endangering its unity as a state as well as threatening his program of political and economic reforms
appealing for calm and for the cool consideration of grievances after weeks of continuing unrest in scattered areas of the country gorbachev made clear the leaderships fear that the nation is heading into a political maelstrom that could tear the soviet union apart
as president gorbachev said it is his duty to warn you about the mounting danger of worsening interethnic relations and the consequences for society for every family and for every person
the fate of perestroika and the unity of our state is at stake he declared in a sober minute address broadcast on radio and television
irresponsible slogans political instigation setting one national group against another the domination of some ethnic groups by others  this could lead to disaster for us all
the living and the succeeding generations will curse those who pushed the nation on this course and those who failed to caution it against the dangers involved in time to prevent madness
with serious ethnic clashes in soviet central asia over the past month with troops needed to maintain the peace in the southern republics of armenia azerbaijan and georgia and with nationalism growing stronger in the baltic republics of estonia latvia and lithuania gorbachev is struggling to hold the soviet union together as a state while he pushes broad reforms that he believes will resolve most of the grievances
even as he spoke soviet officials reported new violence in the south  this time between georgians and azerbaijanis inside the georgian republic but in an area with many azerbaijanis
roving gangs armed with hunting rifles gasoline bombs and other weapons had clashed in three towns south of the capital of tbilisi last week leaving one man dead and  people seriously wounded
although limited so far in scope some of the ethnic conflicts could grow to the point where various regions of the country would be thrown into virtual civil war gorbachev suggested and some national republics could find themselves in violent disputes with their neighbors
those who encourage the unrest are playing with fire gorbachev said warning that the government will use its full powers and take the most decisive measures against those provoking the clashes organizing attacks on minority groups or urging secession
nearly  people have been killed in communal clashes and related political disturbances over the past two years tens of thousands of people have had to flee their homes including  last month alone to seek refuge from the violence and nearly  special troops are now deployed in various parts of the country to maintain order
there will be no pulling of our punches in relation to those who have taken the criminal path gorbachev said warning of stern measures against those engaged in communal violence or in political agitation
political energy drained the ethnic strife much of it rooted in past soviet policies of domination by ethnic russians or in the forced deportation of hundreds of thousands of people during the stalinist era has increasingly drained the political energy necessary to push through major reforms and has provided conservative critics of reform with a potent argument against faster and broader change
for gorbachev the spread of the unrest has forced the humiliating admission that the soviet union a superpower in world terms cannot ensure the domestic tranquility that is a first priority for any government  nor can it protect its own minorities against pogroms
if the strife here continued and grew he asked what kind of example shall we set for others while calling on the whole of mankind to build a nonviolent world
of equal gravity for gorbachev in domestic political terms has been the growth of not only nationalism but the appearance of secessionist groups in the baltic republics and in armenia georgia and moldavia a soviet republic on the romanian border
the whole issue is believed to have been the subject of a highlevel communist party conference here late last week and gorbachevs unusual television address underscores the threat posed by the conflicts
gorbachev acknowledged that ethnic relations are wound in a tight knot of contradictions because of previous soviet policies particularly the effort to pull the countrys plus ethnic groups into a new soviet nationality with a unified culture
this policy had in fact collided head on with growing ethnic awareness throughout the country and made the problems even worse
past economic policies including the stagnation in many regions under the regime of the late president leonid i brezhnev had also made the problems more acute
we are also reaping today the results of lawlessness in preceding decades  the deportation of whole peoples from their lands and the burying in oblivion of the national interests of small ethnic groups gorbachev said alluding to actions carried out decades ago by the dictator josef stalin
such excesses resulted in indifference to ethnic interests to many outstanding social and economic problems in constituent republics and autonomous regions deformities in the development of the languages and cultures of the countrys different peoples the deteriorating demographic situation and many other negative consequences that ultimately provoked tension in interethnic relations
although these questions will be dealt with during a special meeting of the communist partys policymaking central committee in late july and then debated again by the congress of peoples deputies the countrys new national assembly gorbachev apparently felt that he could not wait for those debates and he set out his own broad guidelines for dealing with the crisis
right of equality everyone regardless of his nationality should feel an equal citizen in any part of the country and have a possibility to exercise all the rights guaranteed by the soviet unions constitution he said
the refusal to recognize the basic principle of equality had led to attacks on minority groups in several parts of the country gorbachev said alluding to the particularly vicious assaults on mesketian turks in uzbekistan last month in which about  people died
the soviet leader outlined an approach that would seek to increase the feeling of various ethnic groups that they are at home in their own land and could preserve and develop their own cultures languages and social traditions with the soviet union evolving politically to be much more of a federal system
gorbachev said that profound transformations in the soviet federation are clearly essential promising further political reforms to make it a real federation and not just one in name only
demands rejected but he declared at the same time his firm opposition to neartotal independence demanded by some nationalists particularly in estonia latvia and lithuania and to the calls by others for the redrawing of the borders of ethnic territories
in quest of the better one should not embark on the path of destroying what has been built and abandoning what has already been given by the federation and what can be multiplied within its framework he said

in the  months since he walked free from prison nelson mandela has played the chief role in talks with president fw
he has spent his moral capital trying unsuccessfully to end the murderous conflict between black political factions
 the radicals in the anc may well use the trial and conviction of mrs mandela to arouse members against nelson mandelas policy of peace and negotiation
 there are rumors that at a national conference next month the radicals will try to move such older leaders as mandela and walter sisulu aside to a nominal senior role
 it is a gloomy picture an elderly man bearing the hopes of peace in south africa beset by problems personal trauma on top of political
but i think it would be wrong to conclude that the south african drama is necessarily heading toward a tragic end
 one reason for a degree of optimism is the way south africans on all sides most of them have dealt with winnie mandelas trial calmly and fairly
de klerk and nelson mandela  and those for whom they speak  have a common interest in creating a new nonracial south africa
they can come only when the government takes further steps to meet the reasonable anc demand for action against violence  in particular a ban on the carrying of socalled cultural weapons such as spears
negotiations must start soon if the moderate center of the public black and white is to retain hope for a peaceful solution

most san franciscoarea homeowners may have to pay for damage from tuesdays earthquake out of their own pockets while insurance companies may reap longterm benefits from higher rates industry spokesmen and analysts said wednesday
only  percent to  percent of california homeowners have earthquake insurance which typically requires a  percent deductible and costs between  to  a year for a  home according to industry spokesmen
the association of california insurance cos in sacramento said that in the san francisco area roughly  to  percent of the homes have earthquake insurance
the organization estimated residential damages from tuesdays earthquake at  million in the bay area with between  million to  million insured
insured homeowners without earthquake protection will get reimbursed only if their homes were ravaged by fire which is covered under basic homeowner insurance polices said hugh strawn director of catastrophe services at the property loss research bureau in schaumburg ill insurance companies attempted wednesday to assess the amount of quakerelated damages theyre likely to have to pay
in addition to home damage the companies likely will get claims for automobile damage broken glass theft and burglary business interruption due to electrical outages water damage and possibly workers compensation
but industry observers said they dont expect any company to suffer serious financial damage from quakerelated claims
we dont think any company is going to have problems paying claims said elisa siegal public affairs manager for the american insurance association a washingtonbased trade group
industry analysts predicted insurers would be able to reverse three years of declining rates and win rate hikes from state regulators due to the quake damages and the estimated  billion in damages from hurricane hugo which hammered south carolina and other parts of the southeastern united states earlier this month
an increase in insurance rates could translate into greater profitability in the long term the analysts said
theres a perception that this could turn the cycle  that this could be enough to firm pricing said gloria l vogel an analyst with bear stearns  co inc in new york
despite their predictions for the long run the analysts warned that fourthquarter earnings among insurance companies are likely to be disappointing

george deukmejian is right to call the legislature into special session within the next two weeks to deal with the effects of last tuesdays northern california earthquake
with congress already moving to grant up to  billion in relief earthquake victims need to know that state officials are prepared to come up with the states share of disaster and reconstruction aid as soon as possible and as soon as is practical
deukmejian should be commended as well for advising state officials to do all they can to expedite aid to earthquake victims without getting too tangled up in red tape
the governor is wrong however in his campaign to distance himself from the california department of transportation on the issue of what caused the nimitz freeway in oakland to collapse and what could or should have been done to have prevented it
the governors answer which he has been repeating ever since the day of the quake was that no one in caltrans ever told him a freeway might collapse in an earthquake
this has the earmarks of a preemptive defense against any allegation that california stinted on highway reinforcement because transportation funds have been short during his administration possibly because he had opposed a gasoline tax increase
the major reason is so that california can learn from the experience as it designs new roads and reinforces existing ones against the next quake
while the department of transportation and the state transportation commission do exercise considerable control over the allocation of highway funds the governor also sets general state priorities
the governor complained on sunday that the highway engineers never came to him and told him that bridges or freeways might collapse in an earthquake
but no one who has lived in california more than a few months would rule out the chance that any bridge or freeway could collapse in the right kind of earthquake
the state learns more from every earthquake and a critical need now is to learn everything possible from tuesday oct 
but it is also the time to concentrate on helping quake victims through these most trying days of their experience  the period when the emergency response is over and people face the dreary details of restoring their life to some kind of normality
in the bay area that includes hundreds of thousands of commuters who did not suffer personal damage but face massive obstacles in getting to work
the governor and legislative leaders will meet again next monday to determine the timing and agenda of a special session
it almost certainly would include a temporary gasolinetax increase to deal with highway reconstruction and repair and possible general revenues for other forms of disaster relief
existing law already gives the governor considerable discretion in diverting reserve funds on hand to the office of emergency services for allocation to local governments
the governor and legislature should not wait too long to start the session although they do not yet have precise damage estimates or know just how much the federal government will send to california
the legislature can begin organizing its staff and committees now so the appropriate legislation can be passed as soon as that information is obtained
in the aftermath of the california earthquake president bush and his aides flew into a whirlwind of earthquakerelated activity yesterday morning
some of it was necessary to get federal help flowing to victims but some seemed designed mostly to project an image of a white house in action
mr bush and his aides were accused of responding too slowly after the exxon valdez oil tanker split open in alaskan waters and hurricane hugo struck the carolina coast and they clearly dont want a repeat of those charges now
so the white house announced that mr bush got his first earthquake briefing of the day at  am from chief of staff john sununu
by noon mr bush had taken two phone calls from vice president dan quayle who was in california made a televised statement of concern signed a disaster proclamation received a written report from the federal emergency management agency and visited fema headquarters
on his fema visit mr bush said that he hoped there would be less carping about the emergency offices performance this time adding that the agency took a hit for its reaction to hurricane hugo
the white house already is talking of mr bush visiting the california earthquake site this weekend
insurers face the prospect of paying out billions of dollars for damages caused by this weeks california earthquake
getting a grip on the extent of the damages is proving a far more difficult task than what insurers faced after hurricane hugo ripped through the caribbean and the carolinas last month
the earthquakes toll including possible deep structural damage goes far beyond the more easily observed damage from a hurricane says george reider a vice president in aetna life  casualty insurance cos claims division
but investors are betting that the financial and psychological impact of the earthquake coming so soon after the hurricane will help stem more than two years of intense pricecutting wars among business insurers
most insurers already have mobilized their catastrophe teams to begin processing claims from their policyholders in northern california
since commercial air travel is interrupted aetna based in hartford conn chartered three planes to fly claims adjusters into sacramento and then planned for them to drive to the bay area
about  adjusters were dispatched yesterday afternoon along with laptop computers cellular phones and blank checks
some adjusters already in other parts of california drove to the disaster area with recreational vehicles and mobile homes that could be used as makeshift claimsprocessing centers
insurers will be advertising  numbers  probably on the radio  that policyholders can call to get assistance on how to submit claims
state farm mutual automobile insurance co the largest home and auto insurer in california believes the losses from the earthquake could be somewhat less than the  million in damages it expects to pay out for claims resulting from hurricane hugo
state farm based in bloomington ind is also the largest writer of personalproperty earthquake insurance in california
earthquake insurance is sold as a separate policy or a specific endorsement rider on a homeowners policy in california because of the areas vulnerability to earthquakes
allstate insurance co a unit of sears roebuck  co said about  of its personal property policyholders  about  in the san franciso area  also have earthquake coverage
the association of california insurance companies estimated damage to residential property could total  million but only  million to  million is insured it said
officials from the american insurance associations propertyclaim service division which coordinates the efforts of the claims adjusters in an area after a natural disaster will be flying to san francisco today
industry officials say the bay bridge  unlike some bridges  has no earthquake coverage either so the cost of repairing it probably would have to be paid out of state general operating funds
however the bridge which charges a  toll each way does have loss of income insurance to replace lost revenue if the operation of the bridge is interrupted for more than seven days
that coverage is provided by a syndicate of insurance companies including firemans fund corp based in novato calif and cigna corp based in philadelphia
earthquakerelated claims arent expected to cause significant financial problems for the insurance industry as a whole
instead even with the liabilities of two natural disasters in recent weeks analysts said the total capital of the industry is likely to be higher at year end than it was at midyear
for example insurers may seek to limit their future exposure to catastrophes by increasing the amount of reinsurance they buy
such increased demand for reinsurance along with the losses the reinsurers will bear from these two disasters are likely to spur increases in reinsurance prices that will later be translated into an overall price rise
we are saying this is the breaking point this is the event that will change the psychology of the marketplace said william yankus an analyst with conning  co a hartford firm that specializes in the insurance industry
among the insurance stocks big gainers included american international group up  to  general re corp up  to  aetna up  to  and marsh  mclennan inc up  to 
i think there is a damned good chance someone is going to hit the skids on this said oppenheimer  co analyst myron picoult
he suspects some insurers who had purchased reinsurance to limit their exposure to catastrophes will discover that reinsurance was used up by hurricane hugo
british west german scandinavian and other overseas insurers are bracing for big claims from the san francisco earthquake disaster
although its unclear how much exposure the london market will face uk underwriters traditionally have a large reinsurance exposure to us catastrophe coverage
jack byrne chairman of firemans fund said this disaster will test the catastrophe reinsurance market causing these rates to soar
the catastrophe losses sustained by insurers this year will probably be the worst on an inflationadjusted basis since   when another earthquake sparked the great san francisco fire
orin kramer an insurance consultant in new york estimates that the  san francisco destruction on an inflationadjusted basis included insured losses of  billion
he is estimating this weeks disaster will generate insured losses of  billion to  billion following about  billion in costs to insurers from hurricane hugo

the storm also skirted puerto rico without causing any damage to military facilities ross said
sheets said gilbert was expected next to sweep over the cayman islands on its westward track and in two to three days veer northwest into the southern gulf of mexico
the national weather service warned that the caymans could expect high waters and large waves which may undermine buildings along the beaches
forecaster hal gerrish on sunday described gilbert certainly one of the larger systems weve seen in the caribbean for a long time
hurricane gilbert one of the strongest storms ever slammed into the yucatan peninsula wednesday and leveled thatched homes tore off roofs uprooted trees and cut off the caribbean resorts of cancun and cozumel

the mexican national weather service reported winds gusting as high as  mph earlier wednesday with sustained winds of  mph
earlier wednesday gilbert was classified as a category  storm the strongest ad deadliest type of hurricane
by wednesday night the national hurricane center downgraded it to a category  but center director bob sheets saidtheres no question itll strengthen again once it comes off the yucatan peninsula and gets back in open water
as gilbert moved away from the yucatan peninsula wednesday night the hurricane formed a double eye two concentric circles of thunderstorms often characteristic of a strong storm that has crossed land and is moving over the water again
one eye was about eight miles wide and the second about  miles wide said hurricane center meteorologist jesse moore
this is one of the features that we expected to see as the hurricane moved back over the water and we do expect intensification he said
only two category  hurricanes have hit the united states  the  storm that killed  people in florida and hurricane camille that devastated the mississippi coast in  killing  people
the peninsula ports of campeche celestum progreso sinzal ucaltepen telchac cancun puerto morelos and ciudad del carmen were closed the government news agency notimex said

winds destroyed at least  homes in slums of valladolid a town of about  about  miles from cozumel alberto pol a judicial police officer said by telephone
the national hurricane center said gilbert was the most intense storm on record in terms of barometric pressure
thats the lowest pressure ever measured in the western hemisphere said forecaster mark zimmer
hurricane gilberts growth from a harmless low pressure zone off africa to a ferocious killer in the gulf of mexico was fueled by a combination of heat moisture and wind that baffles forecasters
its a matter of getting everything together in the right place in the right time gil clark of the national hurricane center said thursday
gilbert came to the attention of center forecasters sept  as a dry low pressure trough moving west out of africa
why gilbert organized and strengthened while other systems didnt is a mystery more or less said university of miami meteorology professor rainer bleck
the first part of the summer we were biting our nails wondering why these other disturbances didnt develop he said thursday
if that happens in an area where theres plenty of moisture in the lower atmosphere the bottom  feet or so this convergence may lead to upward motion and cloud formation bleck said
if clouds form the heat of condensation in the clouds occasionally provides positive feedback to the convergence pattern
the hurricane center said gilbert was the most intense storm on record in terms of barometric pressure measured at  inches tuesday night
hurricane gilbert swept toward jamaica yesterday with mileanhour winds and officials issued warnings to residents on the southern coasts of the dominican republic haiti and cuba
forecasters said the hurricane was gaining strength as it passed over the ocean and would dump heavy rain on the dominican republic and haiti as it moved south of hispaniola the caribbean island they share and headed west

the store manager of the walmart in this community on the outskirts of dallas tells a story that gives an insight into the man considered responsible for a retailing phenomenon
manager don bost remembers one day last summer when a secretary telephoned from walmart stores incs corporate headquarters in bentonville ark
chairman sam walton was about to land at a nearby airport and the secretary asked if someone could fetch him and bring him to the de soto store
paying unexpected calls on stores is one way walton has kept in close touch with everyday goingson
says ed nagy district manager for  stores in the dallas metropolitan area its not like uhoh someones coming because theyre always out
everyone from walmart president and chief operating officer david glass down to an hourly store worker can readily quote the gospel according to sam as he is called
he shuns the limelight that his companys success has shed on him and has decided to refuse almost all press requests for interviews
walmart employees became known as associates under a company effort to prove it cared about employees partly to thwart a union organizing effort in the late s
a close associate says sam would probably give anything not to be named on fortune magazines list of the countrys wealthiest people
he graduated from the university of missouri with an economics degree in  and joined jc penney co as a management trainee in des moines iowa
after serving three years in the army he went to arkansas and opened a ben franklin fiveanddime store eventually becoming the companys biggest franchisee
the seeds of the walmart empire were sown when sam and his brother james l or bud opened the first walmart discount city in 
three of the four grown children sam and his wife helen had are involved with the company in various capacities

walton often attends promotional events for his arkansasbased chain and sively said he had suspected the boss might make an appearance
hes ranked as the richest man in the nation by a leading business magazine but to folks in bentonville a town of about  people sam walton is just another neighbor
hes just a part of the community said curt loyd executive director of the bentonville chamber of commerce
walton who prefers birdhunting tennis and opening new walmart stores to trumpeting his personal financial holdings is again shunning publicity about his third consecutive ranking among the worlds top billionaires
according to forbes magazines july  edition the walton familys estimated worth is  billion up from its  estimate of  billion
he is unavailable said walmart spokesman don shinkle of the silverhaired founder of the nations thirdlargest retail chain based in bentonville about  miles northwest of little rock
shinkle said he received about  calls from reporters monday morning when the forbes list appeared in newspapers
he feels any attention to sam walton is to the individual and he prefers attention to sam walton the founder of the company shinkle said
just after the  stock market crash in which waltons familyowned chunk of walmart stock lost millions in value he quipped in response to questions at a news conference on another topic that it was only paper
shinkle said walton stays busy visiting many of the more than  stores operated by the company he started as a single fiveanddime at rogers more than two decades ago
he spends most of his time talking to associates and customers shinkle said and he always comes back with many ideas from them
when walton first made the forbes list of richest americans recalled little rock investment banker warren simpson calls came in from all over about the billionaire from the ozarks
they wanted to know about the stock and the company said simpson who works for stephens inc youd think that hed be living in new york or la not bentonville arkansas
forty years after sam walton first hung out his shingle waltons  will reopen to show how a little rural storekeeper built a discount retail empire
walmart stores incs visitors center opens wednesday in the same building on the downtown square where walton first opened for business on may  
the center chronicles the rise of the nations fastestgrowing discount chain using displays and audiovideo presentations
the window displays date back to the stores opening with simplicity patterns and johnsons glocoat a box of dreft and some ivory snow
also on display at the center is the hula skirt that sam walton donned for his dance on wall street which he performed after challenging the company to reach a record  percent pretax profit in 
the old and the modern together reflect the corporate culture of the nations biggest discount retailer behind k mart corp of detroit

and walmart vice chairman donald soderquist recalls that when walton took his idea of putting discount stores in rural areas to ben franklin headquarters in chicago officials there just really didnt see a future in it
don shinkle walmarts director of corporate and public affairs attributed walmarts success to its associates  the term for employees first coined in  to stress that all walmart employees are partners in the company  and to sam waltons leadership and knack for hiring the right person at the right time
sams wholesale club closed out the year with  units and walmart announced plans to enter the california market
the son of an oklahoma realestate broker he opened the first general store in what was to become the walmart chain in bentonville in the backwaters of arkansas in  writes martin dickson
by  the chains sales had risen to nearly dollars bn making it the worlds largest retailer in terms of revenues and the walton family probably americas richest
the chains success stemmed both from mr waltons personality and willingness to challenge accepted retailing orthodoxy
he was a frugal modest man who worked extremely long hours from a spartan room in his bentonville headquarters but delighted in getting out of the office to tour stores and meet customers and staff whom he insisted on calling associates
he would deliver peptalks to employees extolling the virtues of thrift and customer satisfaction long before these became fashionable management buzzwords
employee satisfaction  an idea which is only now gaining wider acceptance in us service industries  was also a vital ingredient in the walton philosophy
he buoyed staff morale with cheerleading sessions bonus payments for good performance and profitsharing plans which allowed some employees of very modest means to retire relatively wealthy
eight years ago when walmarts profits were better than expected he kept a promise to staff by dressing in a grassskirt to dance the hula on wall street
also essential to walmarts growth was its pioneering of high volume cutprice retailing throughout the year rather than the periodic sales which rivals relied on to generate customer loyalty
mr walton also disproved the conventional wisdom that large discount stores could not operate successfully in the small rural towns of the us south
it was precisely such locations which became the bedrock of the business though in the process walmart put out of business hundreds of small main street stores prompting bitter resistance in some towns which mr walton tended to blunt with generous charitable donations
sam walton founder of the walmart chain of discount supermarkets who died of cancer in april negotiated these pitfalls much better than most
when in  forbes magazine declared him americas richest entrepreneur the paparazzi descended on the obscure corner of arkansas mainly occupied by chicken farmers where walton made his home
what they found was a happily married muchliked billionaire who enjoyed quail hunting breakfasted at the local holiday inn and drove a battered pickup truck minus two hubcaps
since then some aspects of walmarts business  its antiunion policies the impact of its dollars bn annual sales on hundreds of momandpop shops have been subject to critical scrutiny
readers will either find his autobiography lashed with good ol commonsense and a lot of harmless if charming anecdotes
walton makes no excuses i realise this may sound boring to most you he writes at one stage but one of my best items ever was a mattress pad called a bedmate 
there cannot be many billionaires who admit that they never learned handwriting too well  and have the guts to include a photograph which demonstrates the point
in one of many contributions from friends and family don soderquist walmarts chief operating officer tells of finding sam one saturday morning on his hand and knees at the local kmart store analysing his rivals stock
and his wife in a casual aside notes that when the couple was on holiday in italy their luggage vanished while her husband was off on a similar scouting mission
but it is david glass walmarts current chief executive who perhaps captures the entrepreneurial walton spirit best
explaining the annual contest in which walmart executives choose one volume producing item to promote he recalls the time sam who usually won selected minnow buckets for carrying bait
sam walton was a salesman to the core and seems to have packaged himself with all the skill that he once applied to selling a gooey southern sweet called moon pies
i had bought a bank in bentonville for about about dollars  walton remarks for example just a little old bank with only about dollars m in deposits
the real truth one suspects comes right at the end of the book  when walton admits that if i hadnt gotten sick i doubt i would have written this book
given the pleadings of publishers  doubleday paid about dollars m for the manuscript  and a rather natural desire to have a final say he can hardly be blamed for agreeing to write it
walmart a history of sam waltons retail phenomenon by sandra s vance and roy v scott twayne publishers new york dollars   pages many people might be said to be the personification of the american dream few are better qualified for that title than sam walton
walton is a character it would be difficult to invent an allamerican boy who became one of the worlds most successful businessmen
the churchgoing son of a farmer born in  near kingfisher oklahoma he founded a store chain which made him americas richest man and which shortly before his death in  became the worlds biggest retailer
his company walmart made sales of dollars bn last year and after waltons death fortune magazine reported that his wife and four children held between them the secondlargest fortune in the world  dollars bn
although walton built up a small chain of ben franklin variety store franchises from  it was not until  that he opened his first walmart discount store
at the time of its incorporation in  walmart had only  outlets with sales of dollars m  not enough to earn a place in trade journal discount merchandisers list of the  biggest us discount retailers
its turnover was only  per cent of that of sears roebuck the biggest and  per cent of k mart the secondbiggest
apart from waltons autobiography completed shortly before his death however published material about the company is curiously scarce
this book attempts to fill the gap to provide a scholarly account of the rise of walmart setting it in the wider context of us retailing and explaining how it was achieved
rather he realised the threat discounting posed to his own variety store business and studied in depth many of the uss leading discounters of the early s including ann and hope e j korvette spartans fedmart and k mart
walton learned from them all but was unique in taking his discount stores into small towns of a few thousand people where shoppers used to travelling long distances were delighted to have a cutprice store nearby selling everything they needed
as early as the s walton realised he was wasting too much time travelling and bought a small aircraft to pilot between stores himself  something he continued to do to the end of his life
sometimes walton was more reluctant to invest in technology and had to be persuaded by colleagues to introduce computers and scanning at checkouts  long before most retailers had recognised their importance  and to invest dollars m in an internal satellite communications system
but perhaps the most fundamental reason for its success the book suggests has been walmarts streamlined and highly responsive management structure
regional vicepresidents based at group headquarters in bentonville arkansas rather than in costly regional offices are despatched every monday by aircraft to their regions spend the week visiting stores working with staff and managers and return for a daylong merchandising meeting every friday
they discuss results problems and suggestions from the week at a am meeting on saturdays and immediately afterwards call district managers to relate the results
district managers hold a conference call with their store managers and before the day is out the contents of the meeting have been communicated to all store department heads
the system means employees can make suggestions to vicepresidents one week and if the idea is accepted by the saturday meeting see its implementation begin the following week
one was waltons decision to stand down from the chairman and chief executives role in  in favour of ronald mayer only to return to both roles in  after finding he was incapable of letting go of the reins
then there was waltons rash promise to do a hula dance on wall street if walmart achieved an  per cent pretax profit margin in 
the book also covers well the debate over whether walmarts impact on the economies of small us towns was positive or negative
if there are criticisms these are that this scholarly account never quite captures the sheer excitement of working in the worlds fastestgrowing retailer
moreover it makes little attempt to predict whether walmart can continue its growth and conquer the rest of the world in the way it conquered the us
while hurricane andrew was wreaking havoc across large parts of southern florida and louisiana this week a grade two dollar crisis on a onetofour scale four being most severe was blowing itself out at the end of a tumultuous few days for us and world financial markets
on wall street most of the damage from the currency storm was inflicted a week ago friday and on the following monday when bond yields jumped sharply and the dow jones industrial average plunged by more than  points
the flimsy walls erected hastily by the federal reserve and other big central banks to protect the vulnerable dollar from a tidal wave of selling on foreign exchange markets failed to hold and as the sellers poured through the breached barricades the currency dropped to dm
interest rate differentials between us and germany widened over the summer as the fed eased and the bundesbank tightened their respective monetary policies
the failure of the us economy to climb out of recession with any vigour was also making overseas investors increasingly unhappy about holding the dollar
so too was the political hole president bush had dug for himself in a reelection battle that only a year ago was supposed to be a shooin for the incumbent
moreover the fact that almost every central bank worth its salt was in the markets trying to prop up the dollar served only to convince foreign exchange dealers that the currency was heading in one direction  down
while there were plenty of reasons for the dealers to sell the dollar the logic for such a strongly negative reaction from bond and stock markets was less obviously compelling
the second is that it makes it hard for the fed to engineer another cut in interest rates to stimulate the flagging recovery and raises the possibility that rates may actually have to go up to protect the currency
the first explanation is not particularly convincing  imports account for not much more than  per cent of us gross domestic product so higher import prices do not greatly effect the overall price level which is now around  per cent and heading lower
although there is not much chance given the present economic and political climate that the fed will raise rates to help the dollar there is little doubt that the currencys weakness makes it extremely difficult for the fed to ease monetary policy again
the fear that the fed may be done with interest rate cuts for the present economic cycle was also behind the selling in equity markets
just over a week ago the yield on the benchmark year bond which has remained stubbornly high all year despite the poor state of the economy looked as if it might drop below  per cent
the dollar put paid to those hopes and by the middle of this week it was approaching  per cent putting an upward pressure on the allimportant mortgage rate for homebuyers
the dollar was not the only story in financial markets this week and the devastating effect of hurricane andrew produced a typically hardeyed although nonetheless logical reaction from wall street
the stocks of those insurance companies with the greatest exposure in southern florida the area hit worst by the hurricane all took a tumble
but the relatively modest losses in geico travelers and progressive suggested that the market believed the insurers were reserved or reinsured adequately enough to cover hurricanerelated claims
the flip side of the hurricanes coin was a strong showing from the stocks of home construction companies expected to benefit from demand for rebuilding damaged or destroyed homes
the biggest gains among construction stocks this week were posted by lennar oakwood homes engle homes and fleetwood the largest maker of premanufactured homes in the us
squads of workers fanned out across stormbattered louisiana yesterday to begin a massive rebuilding effort after hurricane andrew had flattened whole districts killing two people and injuring dozens more agencies report from florida and new orleans
however local officials in florida hit earlier in the week by the hurricane were critical of what they called a delay in supplying food drinking water and other supplies for thousands of people in need
federal emergency officials acknowledged distribution problems transportation secretary andrew card yesterday promised dramatic improvements within  hours and president george bush last night ordered troops to florida without specifying a number
the government estimated it would cost dollars bndollars bn to tidy and rebuild in florida and to care for residents displaced by the storm
louisiana state officials said they had no overall count of stormrelated injuries but initial estimates reckoned fewer than 
the federal emergency management agency said it was setting aside dollars m to help louisiana recover
most of the storms fury was spent against sparsely populated farming communities and swampland in the state sparing it the widespread destruction caused in florida where  people died
official estimates in miami reported that the hurricane had wiped out the homes of one dade county resident in eight  a quarter of a million people
andrew had become little more than a strong rainstorm early yesterday moving across mississippi state and heading for the northeastern us
wildlife and fisheries secretary joe herring estimated a  per cent decline in the alligator industry
most louisiana oil refineries however were barely affected and deliveries of crude oil were expected to resume yesterday
general accident the leading british insurer said yesterday that insurance claims arising from hurricane andrew could cost it as much as dollars m
lord airlie the chairman who was addressing an extraordinary shareholders meeting said on the basis of emerging information general accident advise that the losses to their us operations arising from hurricane andrew which struck florida and louisiana might in total reach the level at which external catastrophe reinsurance covers would become exposed
what this means is that ga is able to pass on its losses to external reinsurers once a certain claims threshold has been breached
mr nelson robertson gas chief general manager explained later that the company has a  per cent share of the florida market
hurricane andrew claimed to be the costliest natural disaster in us history yesterday smashed its way through the state of louisiana inflicting severe damage on rural communities but narrowly missing the lowlying city of new orleans
the storm which brought havoc to southern florida on monday and then headed northwest across the gulf of mexico had made landfall late on tuesday night some  miles southwest of the city in the agricultural cajun country
although the damage from the hurricanes landfall in florida on monday was much greater than initially esti mated insurers losses there are likely to total less than dollars bn well below earlier expectations a senior member of lloyds insurance market said yesterday
in louisiana the hurricane landed with wind speeds of about  miles per hour and caused severe damage in small coastal centres such as morgan city franklin and new iberia
initial reports said at least one person had died  been injured and thousands made homeless along the louisiana coast after  confirmed deaths in florida and three in the bahamas
the storm caused little damage to louisianas important oilrefining industry although some plants had to halt production when electricity was cut
the lloyds member in close contact with leading insurers in florida said that damage to insured property was remarkably small
most of the destruction occurred in a mile band across homestead  miles to the south of miami where a typical house sells for dollars  to dollars 
many destroyed power lines are thought to be uninsured as are trees and shrubs uprooted across a wide area
across florida some m people remained without electric ity yesterday and health officials were warning the public to boil or chemically treat all water
hurricane hugo which devastated much of south carolina in  cost the insurance industry some dollars bn
damage caused by hurricane andrew could rise to dollars bn it was estimated yesterday as one of the costliest us storms this century threatened a further devastating landfall near the city of new orleans
government officials in louisiana mississippi and texas yesterday advised or ordered more than m people to evacuate coastal areas
the hurricane tore through southern florida early on monday morning causing billions of dollars of property damage and at least  deaths and yesterday was moving northwest across the gulf of mexico with winds of about  miles an hour
ms kate hale director of emergency services in floridas dade county which bore the brunt of the storm estimated that andrew had already caused dollars bn to dollars bn pounds bnpounds bn of damage
the us industrys property claims service the official compiler of disaster losses had yet to compile a preliminary tally of the florida bill
a hurricane warning was in effect yesterday along  miles of gulf coast from pascagoula mississippi to galvestone texas
several forecasting agencies suggested the likeliest landfall was in central louisiana to the west of new orleans possibly late last night or this morning
new orleans with a population of m is particularly vulnerable because the city lies below sea level has the mississippi river running through its centre and a large lake immediately to the north
much of americas oil refining industry is concentrated along coastal texas and louisiana and several refineries were yesterday partially shut down
in florida andrew caused greatest havoc in a largely suburban swathe some  miles south of miami
the town of homestead near the centre of the storm was largely flattened including a local air force base
the brunt of insurance claims from the florida storm will fall on the us industry and companies with a heavy local exposure include the state farm group and the allstate insurance unit of sears roebuck
these are also the leading propertycasualty and home insurance groups in louisiana together with american international group
a spokesman for state farm insurance said he believed the company had roughly  per cent of the florida market
its size has made obtaining reinsurance cover difficult and its reserves at about dollars bn have made it unnecessary
according to balcombe group a ukbased claims adjustment firm other insurers with large exposure in the hurricanehit area are hartford insurance aetna and travellers
about  per cent of travellers home insurance premium income came from florida last year and  per cent of its commercial insurance premiums
the last serious us hurricane hugo which struck south carolina in  cost the industry dollars bn from insured losses though estimates of the total damage caused ranged between dollars bn and dollars bn
us cities along the gulf of mexico from alabama to eastern texas were on storm watch last night as hurricane andrew headed west after sweeping across southern florida causing at least eight deaths and severe property damage
the hurricane was one of the fiercest in the us in decades and the first to hit miami directly in a quarter of a century
in the bahamas government spokesman mr jimmy curry said four deaths had been reported on outlying eastern islands
mr justin balcombe of ukbased insurance adjuster balcombe group said total losses could exceed dollars bn if business interruption claims were taken into account
that compares with the dollars bndollars n pounds bnpounds bn of insurance industry losses caused by the last big us hurricane hugo which hit south carolina in 
the brunt of the losses are likely to be concentrated among us insurers industry analysts said yesterday
mr george lloydroberts chairman of lloyds underwriters nonmarine association said that unless damage claims exceeded pounds bn the lloyds insurance market would feel little impact
because the reinsurance of reinsurance risk  known as the retrocession market  has shrunk considerably in recent years us insurers have placed far fewer of their risks through lloyds
mr roger hill insurance analyst at warburg securities said he estimated that mainline uk insurers faced no more than pounds m in damage claims so far
among other uk insurers mr hill estimated that general accident may face losses of up to pounds m while guardian royal exchange faced pounds m and sun alliance and commercial union pounds m each
however hurricane andrew gathered fresh strength as it moved across the gulf of mexico and there was concern last night that it might head towards new orleans which is especially low lying and could suffer severe flood damage
scientists said the storm could make landfall anywhere between the alabama port of mobile and the louisianatexas border probably tomorrow night or early thursday
a substantial part of americas oil refining industry is concentrated on the gulf coast in louisiana and texas and officials there were reviewing emergency plans to curtail or shut down plant operations
andrew the first caribbean hurricane of the season hit the eastern coast of florida early yesterday gusting up to mph
it ripped roofs off houses smashed cars and trucks snapped power lines and uprooted trees before heading out over the gulf
a million people had been ordered to flee their homes in southern florida as the hurricane moved in from the bahamas on sunday
some of the strongest winds were in the affluent suburb of coral gables just south of miami where the national hurricane center is located
president bush authorised federal disaster assistance for the affected areas and made plans for an inspection tour of the state
the communist world gets its first mcdonalds next week and some people here are wondering whether its american hamburgers will be as popular as the local fastfood treat pljeskavica
the longawaited opening of the restaurant on one of belgrades main downtown squares will take place march  the yugoslav news agency tanjug reported and it will offer big macs fries and the other specialities familiar to mcdonalds customers in the west
the belgrade media have suggested that the success of the american restaurant depends on its acceptance by yugoslavians who are long accustomed to the hamburgerlike pljeskavica
in fact this is a clash between the big mac and pljeskavica said an official of genex yugoslavias largest staterun enterprise that will operate the mcdonalds
john onoda a spokesman at mcdonalds oak brook ill headquarters said it was the first of the chains outlets in a communist country
the next east european mcdonalds is scheduled to be opened in budapest hungary by the end of this year said vesna milosevic another genex official
communism suffered its first big mac attack thursday as mcdonalds opened a restaurant in yugoslavia and police were called in to keep customers who lined up for hours from getting too unruly under the golden arches
i just wanted to taste genuine american hamburgers said milica nikolic a high school student who waited for three hours to taste her first big mac
people curiously examined the renovated restaurants plush interior and the backlit signs depicting the hamburgers french fries milk shakes and other fare more familiar in the west
it also featured ambercolored tables and floors pastelcolored upholstery modern art paintings and discreet illumination
the fastfood outlet located on a downtown square had drawn crowds in recent days and they began gathering long before it opened thursday
police kept watch on the lines of customers snaking around the block and they regulated the number who came inside to avoid overcrowding
i think this restaurant has no competition in belgrade said milica danic a housewife who treated her son to a cheeseburger
the belgrade media have suggested that the success of mcdonalds in yugoslavia depends on its acceptance by citizens long accustomed to a hamburgerlike fastfood dish called the pljeskavica ground pork and onions on a bun
in fact this is a clash between the big mac and pljeskavica said vesna milosevic an official of genex a yugoslav staterun enterprise that has contracted a joint venture agreement with mcdonalds
our aim is not to destroy the pljeskavica on the yugoslav market said predrag dostanic managing director of the genexmcdonalds
this contrasts sharply with the balkan and yugoslav custom of sitting with a drink in smokefilled restaurants and chatting with friends after the meal
the big mac meal consisting of a hamburger soft drink and french fries costs the equivalent of  or about as much the similar meal would cost in numerous pljeskavica joints around town
sadik seljami a waiter in a small pljeskavica outlet just a few hundred yards from the mcdonalds suggested that the american restaurant wants to drive yugoslav fastfood outlets out of business
glen cook an executive of the mcdonalds corp said during the opening ceremonies we are very excited about the opening of this restaurant not only because it is the first one in a communist country but also because it is one of the nicest in europe
in an effort to keep a high level of services the management is entitled to fire any employees who fail to perform
the american corporation plans to open five additional restaurants yugoslavia in the next five years
the next east european mcdonalds and the first in a soviet bloc country is to open next month in budapest hungary
thousands of queuehardened soviets on wednesday cheerfully lined up to get a taste of gamburgers chizburgers and filayofeesh sandwiches as mcdonalds opened in the land of lenin for the first time
the worlds largest version of the landmark american fastfood chain rang up  meals on  cash registers breaking the openingday record for mcdonalds worldwide officials said
the soviets bundled in fur coats and hats seemed unfazed lining up before dawn outside the seat restaurant the first of  planned across the soviet union
the crush of customers was so intense the company stayed open until midnight two hours later than planned
i only waited an hour and i think they served thousands before me said a happy middleaged woman who works at an aluminum plant
big macs were priced at  rubles and double cheeseburgers at  rubles  about two hours pay for a starting mcdonalds staffer or the average soviet but much cheaper than other private restaurants that have sprung up recently
the official exchange rate is  per ruble but foreign visitors can buy rubles for  cents each about what the currency is worth on the black market
half the days sales were donated to the soviet childrens fund which provides medical care and assistance to orphans and disadvantaged children gary reinblatt senior vice president of mcdonalds canada said from toronto
the restaurant built by the company in a joint venture with the city of moscow that began  years ago brought to  the number of countries where mcdonalds operates
besides its restaurants in the united states the leading number of mcdonalds are in canada and japan the officials said
normally dour citizens broke into grins as they caught the infectious cheerful mood from youthful soviet staffers hired for their ability to smile and work hard
accordions played folk songs and women in traditional costumes danced with cartoon characters including mickey mouse and baba yaga a witch of russian fairy tales
one muscovite accustomed to clerks who snarl if they say anything at all asked for a straw and was startled when a smiling young soviet woman found him one and popped it straight into his drink
sandwiches were served in the familiar bag marked with the golden arches but were packed in wrappers bearing cyrillic letters approximating gamburger
its a lot different from a stolovaya he continued with a smile referring to the much cheaper but rundown dirty cafeterias that slop rice and fat or boiled sausage
under the sign of the golden arches accented by the soviet hammerandsickle flag hundreds lined up for the longawaited grand opening at  am on pushkin square reaching out excitedly for mcdonalds flags and pins as the hamburger chains army fulfilled the soviet penchant for souvenirs with western logos
mcdonalds of canada chairman george cohon the man behind the deal said many people were buying multiple orders and the restaurant served  to  people in just the first five hours of operation
mcdonalds built its own factory including bakery dairy meatprocessing plant and even potato storage yard to provide its own guaranteed supplies in a country where up to  percent of the harvest rots en route to the consumer
one mcdonalds associate said the company wound up importing wooden crates from finland for storing potatoes because when they went to build crates they found there was no wood and no nails
mcdonalds hamburgers fries and golden arches came to china on monday when the fastfood chain opened its first restaurant in a nation famed for its distinctive cuisine
hundreds of chinese waited for hours outside the restaurant in shenzhen an economic boom town near hong kong for their first taste of a mcdonalds hamburger fries or shake
i travelled for four hours from a village to get here said huang rongti  who has lost most of her teeth because of age
the opening of a us fastfood restaurant in china where cooking has long been considered a culinary art may seem odd to gourmets
in canton  miles northwest of shenzhen chefs specialize in some of the more exotic chinese dishes such as cat stew bear paws chicken feet and a famed snake dish  dragon and tiger locked in battle  made from three kinds of poisonous snakes stewed with leopard meat and garnished with  spices lemon leaves and chrysanthemum petals
however many chinese who earn an average  a month are still unable to afford fancy meals at restaurants
in shenzhen a chinese special economic zone where foreign investors have built factories salaries are higher and workers earn an average of  a month
another us fast food outlet kentucky fried chicken opened a restaurant in beijing in  and it now has four outlets there
although kentucky fried chicken has become popular the average chinese still regards a meal there as a treat rather than a convenience and mcdonalds could face the same problems
the seat mcdonalds restaurant in a threestory building is operated by mcdonalds restaurant shenzhen ltd a wholly owned subsidiary of mcdonalds hong kong
the younger chen returned recently from a course at mcdonalds hamburger university in oak brook ill
daniel ng chairman of mcdonalds restaurant shenzhen ltd said it took two years to prepare for the restaurants opening and his ambition now is to serve  million burgers a year
last month when mcdonalds advertized for  staffers for the restaurant it received applications from more than  persons including college graduates officials said
i feel i have a better job prospect working here and it pays better said henry he  who has a masters degree in garment and textile
a factory worker who waited several hours before she was able to purchase her hamburger said she liked it because of its sweet taste  the result of tomato ketchup which is not commonly used in traditional chinese cooking
as the value of the rouble plunges and potential foreign investors worry about a host of obstacles to investing in russia russian officials had several reasons yesterday to feel thankful for mcdonalds hamburgers
opening the second mcdonalds restaurant in moscow along with a storey office block mr george cohon head of mcdonalds canada could well be described as the russian authorities idea of a model investor
mcdonalds proven determination to be here for the long term and to serve russians in their own currency as opposed to the dollars charged by most other foreign joint ventures are just a couple of reasons for russian gratitude
mr viktor khlystun the agriculture minister praised the fact that mcdonalds gets most of its supplies from inside russia after setting up a dollars m processing plant outside moscow
he also thanked mcdonalds for providing jobs a model of western standards for the countrys decrepit service industry and finally for what he described as the most delicious food
but despite the jolly opening ceremony  with big macs musicians playing the balalaika and hundreds of yellow balloons forming a giant m  life has been tough for mcdonalds since it opened its first restaurant in moscow   years ago
although the first moscow restaurant is the busiest mcdonalds in the world the plunging rouble high inflation and constantly changing tax rules have been a challenge to mcdonalds management who admitted that they have no idea of when it could recoup its initial dollars m investment
it will depend on how rapidly we can open new restaurants what happens to the rouble what happens to raw materials that we buy
apart from housing the restaurant on the ground floor the mcdonalds office block is rented out to western companies in an attempt to generate hard currency alongside the mountains of roubles made from selling hamburgers
when the doors swung open wednesday at the first mcdonalds restaurant in the soviet union thousands of muscovites poured in to sip milk cocktails and taste their first beeg mak gamburgers picking them apart to marvel at the fixins
some expressed wonder at the speedy service  only an hour in line  while others heralded the event as the first evidence that president mikhail s gorbachevs economic reforms are finally filtering down to the average muscovite
although cynics might complain of the steady homogenizing of world cultures the arrival of the fastfood chain here   years after a canadian mcdonalds official broached the idea with soviet officials at the  montreal olympics  was without doubt a major event
most customers seemed thrilled to be part of it even though some of them gave the big mac sandwich a mixed review
it was very interesting that gamburger zvetlana generotova  said leaving with a large paper bag filled with takeout food also a new concept here
russians say gamburger because they pronounce western words that begin with h as though they begin with g another customer victor kunyasev said well my wife makes better food
in honor of the grand opening a brigade of workers distributed mcdonalds flags and pins entertainers performed on the accordion and sang folk songs under golden arches adorned with the soviet hammer and sickle
the worlds largest mcdonalds with  cash registers and a seating capacity of  brings to moscow not only hamburgers french fries and shakes called milk cocktails here but also a living lesson in westernstyle marketing
at training sessions before opening day cashiers were taught the importance of greeting customers cheerfully of saying please and thank you  all of which promises something distinctly different from the typically surly service at most of moscows dingy state cafes
lebedeva  who formerly worked as deputy director of a small food store said that to be this polite and to have everything this clean is new for the workers as well as for the customers
sam yahel from mcdonalds in atlanta who helped train the  soviet workers said the soviet trainees were at a disadvantage because in most other parts of the world new workers had at least eaten at one of the restaurants
they practiced cooking using yellow cardboard squares in place of cheese and different colored poker chips in place of onions tomatoes and pickles
while most of the soviet workers trained for a matter of days the four soviet managers of the restaurant spent nine months abroad learning their jobs
the moscow mcdonalds will be open for  hours a day beginning at  am and will be able they say to serve more than  customers a day
on wednesday though it stayed open an extra two hours and served a mcdonalds record  meals
the previous record for openingday transactions was  in budapest hungary and the previous record sales for a single day was  in hong kong
virtually every other foreign firm that has come into the soviet union in recent years accepts only hard currencies meaning that it caters primarily to foreigners
the mcdonalds prices are high compared to the state restaurants where a large meal seldom costs more than a ruble
the big mac costs  rubles or about  at the official exchange rate and dinner out for the family can come to two days wages for the average soviet worker
mcdonalds employees are paid  rubles an hour with a chance for an increase of up to  kopecks in three months time
canadian and american officials who have helped train the soviet personnel know that the allure of working for a western firm was a drawing factor but they nonetheless expect a  turnover rate twice their normal average
mcdonalds invested  million in setting up the restaurant and a food processing plant in a moscow suburb that turns out everything from meat patties to sesameseed buns
soviet farmers who are supplying most of the products have been given special training and diseaseresistant seed for potatoes and cucumbers
the extra effort was necessary to guarantee supplies in a country where as much as  of the harvest spoils on the way to the consumer
the joint venture agreement between mcdonalds of canada and the moscow city council calls for  restaurants though there is no timetable or even a definite plan for when or where the second mcdonalds will open
is there any fear that when the golden arches become as common as the cupolas of russian orthodox churches it will be a sign that capitalism is making real inroads in the communist capital
there werent many ideological discussions during these negotiations said marc winer  a native of nashua nh who is general director of the moscow outlet
two corporate executives sat down in an office here last month to talk business with a bunch of clowns
the subject was no laughing matter but rather the serious endeavor of finding south koreas ronald mcdonald
seven years after the us hamburger giant first tried to bring its big macs to south korea the golden arches were finally going up
mcahn industries ltd recently opened the first of what it expects will be a string of burger outlets in seoul
the company is a  joint venture of mcdonalds corp oak brook ill and an accountantturnedentrepreneur ahn hyo young
but its entry into south korea which has asias fastestgrowing economy had been frustrated by its inability to find a suitable partner and to win agreement from seoul on terms
south korea may be one of mcdonalds most promising foreign markets business analysts say
hamburgerrelated fastfood sales in south korea totaled  million last year a  rise from  according to the ministry of finance
analysts say this years rise could be much bigger helped by a  increase in wages in mid and another big pay increase expected soon
the business is likely to profit from the  olympic games in seoul in september and from an anticipated postolympic economic boom here
however the competition is heating up and there is a good possibility that south korea already has reached the fastfood saturation point for its current average income bracket an official for the south korea chamber of commerce and industry says
the competition besides wendys internationals  shops and six of burger king a unit of pillsbury co includes homegrown burger chains
mcdonalds strategy is to take things slowly avoiding extravagances mr ahn and awad sifri mcdonalds marketing director say
equally modest he says will be the initial menu no breakfast no chicken mcnuggets and no products tailored to national tastes as offered elsewhere
the venture is rejecting television commercials in favor of a cheaper more oldfashioned approach a brief advertising campaign in newspapers distribution of fliers and word of mouth
mr sifri says the emphasis will be on developing mcdonalds image as an affordable place for the emerging middle class rather than as a familiar name for foreigners in south korea
two years later mcdonalds and mr ahn each put up  million in capital and borrowed an additional  million to form mcahn
mcdonalds struggled with the government over mcahns royalty payments to the us partner  the issue was resolved  and over tight import restrictions on food products
the import question came down to finding a supplier locally who could supply highquality beef and potatoes at a value mcdonalds said
even mcdonalds golden arches symbol ran into red tape since the city regulates the size and color of signs
dan quayles sister believes the indiana senator wont let his candidacy for vice president hurt the family life he and his wife marilyn enjoy
i dont think it will be tough on the family said martha saddler quayles sister who lives in huntington ind
the quayle family and friends were celebrating tuesday afternoon after george bush announced he wants the yearold indiana senator to be the republican nominee for vice president
those who have known the quayles for years said the senator and his wife have remained relatively unchanged by their years in public life
dan and marilyn quayle met as law students in indianapolis married while they were still in school and remain close to many of their friends from that period
one of the greatest things about him is the job of being a senator has not changed him a bit said indianapolis attorney william r neale treasurer of quayles  reelection campaign
neale who grew up with marilyn tucker quayle in indianapolis introduced dan quayle to his future wife at a student gathering at the indiana university law school in the early s
dan quayle who grew up in huntington graduated from depauw university a small liberal arts college in greencastle ind before going to work in the indiana attorney generals office in 
daniel f evans also a law school classmate of dan quayle said he doesnt expect quayles national candidacy to change him
i think his strength is hell remember who his friends are even after this said evans who was chairman of quayles  campaign
friends said the quayles are devoted to their three children and prefer quiet nights at home to nights out on the town in washington
his family looks like the family both parties are trying to appeal to said mitch daniels former political chief in the white house and now president of the hudson institute
the couple who married in  have a yearold son tucker a yearold son benjamin and a yearold daughter corinne
when they campaign in indiana the quayles often tour in two groups  the boys riding in parades with marilyn quayle and corinne and her father visiting county fairs
in an interview with indiana reporters monday the quayles said they had worried during the vice presidential speculation about the familys loss of privacy during a national campaign
quayle said he had questioned each of his children about whether he should accept the vice presidential spot if bush offered it
benjamin was ambiguous but he thought secret service agents might be able to help him on tests at school mrs quayle said
corinne didnt like the prospect of having her father spend more time away from home quayle said
she told me daddy i really hope george bush picks bob dole said quayle
dan quayle has not yet been nominated for vice president and already republicans are comparing him to thomas jefferson and john f kennedy
sen john warner of virginia who served with quayle on a senate subcommittee told an audience that whenever he heard the indiana senator speak id say there stands the next thomas jefferson
in  the american people voted for john f kennedy for president and he was the relatively same age as dan quayle said ford
the actor who once played the role of a presidential office seeker in the candidate sent quayle a telegram telling him to stop the lookalike references in his congressional campaign literature
quayle said the news media had made the comparison not he and after he was elected sent redford an autographed picture of himself
to help him get known eight fellow senators wednesday took turns telling reporters how much they liked him
we know him well said strom thurmond rsc hes attractive because of his looks hes attractive because of his enthusiasm said sen john mccain rariz i think dan quayle although hes  years of age hes going to send a message to the american people that the republican party respects young people who achieve said sen pete domenici rnm oh yes hes also rich but the senators said that should not hold him back
here is a transcript of the speech by sen bob dole of kansas nominating sen dan quayle of indiana for vice president at the republican national convention on thursday night
mr chairman four of my congressional colleagues and i are here for the purpose of nominating the next vice president of the united states
we are here to nominate one of the bright young lights in the republican party a man i am proud to say is my colleague the junior senator from indiana dan quayle
well three years ago i received a handwritten plea from a yearold girl who after several days of long long senate sessions had a very special problem
corinne and her brothers tucker and benjamin and their mother marilyn share dan quayle with the people of indiana and the united states senate
and whenever i needed him whenever i needed him dan was there  ready and willing to make the tough choices to cast the tough votes to transform president reagans vision of america into the law of the land
whether it was the budget or defense tax reform or the inf treaty dan quayle was there a forceful advocate and a staunch supporter of the reagan revolution
hes got plenty of experience plenty of experience  experience in raising taxes again and again experience in vetoing the pledge of allegiance in public schools experience in increasing spending year after year after year in massachusetts
hes already spent  years as a congressman and a senator tackling the vital national and international issues that affect the lives of all americans and the future of our country
and for the purpose of debate only i yield the balance of my time to the outstanding distinguished senior from indiana my good friend sen dick lugar
dan quayles vice presidential nomination was supposed to be a triumph for the precocious young indiana senator but the dream faded overnight
bushs surprise choice for his running mate was supposed to ignite a campaign that has seemed at times to suffer from lack of inspiration but he quickly encountered questions over his military record and suggestions he could best serve the republicans by withdrawing from the ticket
though he found himself in danger of fizzling thursday quayle managed to stir the convention hall with his upbeat speech about family generations and the rosy future he foresaw under a bush administration
the yearold nominee delivered the speech with calm selfassurance sticking close to his text and avoiding his penchant for extemporaneous remarks  perhaps another result of the unanticipated controversy
retired maj gen wendell c phillippi  who worked for quayles grandfather eugene c pulliam as managing editor of the indianapolis news  said he contacted the national guard on behalf of quayle when the young man applied in  and recommended him very highly the news reported
quayle a hardliner on defense matters has said he sought guard duty so he could attend law school
a bush aide said the matter was discussed with the indiana senator during the process that led to his selection for the bush ticket and quayle had denied that he used influence to gain admittance to the guard
quayle was tense and refused to answer reporters questions about the topic during a brief walkthrough at the convention hall
it was a daunting change for the senator whose youthful vigor rapid political rise striking good looks and wealth have been compared to those of john f kennedy
quayle alluded to the national guard issue during his speech saying he was proud of the six years he served
sen bob dole of kansas who placed quayles name in nomination stressed his campaign skills and sought to deflect concerns that he lacked experience for the job
sen alan simpson of wyoming one of those who seconded the nomination said quayle would bring vim vigor and vitality to the party and would bring sparks and voltage to this campaign
republican vice presidential candidate dan quayles official resume says he was the indiana consumer protection divisions chief investigator a year before the unit was created state records show
officials said quayle served as chief investigator from july until midseptember when he became administrative assistant to thengov
quayles senate biography which his campaign is using as his official background says he was chief investigator of the unit in the attorney generals office from  to 
he was assigned to our section in the spring of  said robert smith the units first director and now an attorney in indianapolis
i didnt hold that job for two years quayle told reporters aboard his campaign plane
earlier however quayle spokesman david prosperi called the revelation of the error by the plain dealer of cleveland a cheap shot
quayle was hired as an entrylevel research assistant by the state attorney generals office in  after he returned from six months of basic and advanced training for the indiana national guard
at no point in any of this did dan quayle ask any favors or use any influence said evans now with the national journalism center in washington dc he wouldnt have been hired as a chief investigator
theodore sendak the attorney general at the time recently had surgery and is unable to comment according to his son timothy sendak
patricia gifford a marion superior court judge who was then an assistant attorney general said friday that prior to the establishment of the consumer protection division all complaints and inquiries were handled by me
the consumer protection division was created by the state legislature to resolve complaints over defective products false claims in ads faulty speedometer readings and mailorder fraud
in  quayle referred to himself as a vietnamera veteran in campaign literature when he was running against threeterm incumbent birch bayh in a senate race
quayle who enlisted in the indiana national guard dropped the reference after objections by some vietnam combat veterans
dan quayle is likely to be a man on the outside in george bushs white house following a vice presidential candidacy that began in a furor but settled into obscurity experts say
encumbered by his image as a political novice who needed a bevy of professional handlers to survive early campaign controversies quayle enters a bush administration in which he has few intimates or allies
relegated in the campaign to small towns and safe gop areas quayle as vice president is likely to be given a traditional ceremonial role  going to political gatherings and state funerals  rather than the advisory role that walter mondale and even bush had some scholars feel
 with quayle its just going to retreat to the old days of politics and funerals said ryan barilleaux a professor of political science at miami university in oxford ohio who studies the american presidency
when asked bush employed the stock lines that quayle would make an outstanding vice president and had been tempered by steel as he weathered the early furor over his military service academic record and personal life
the presidentelect told reporters quayle would have access to the same papers information and intelligence that is available to the president
quayle says bush has talked to him about heading a space council and that he assumes hell have a role in the administrations antidrug efforts
both bush and mondale came to their vice presidential campaigns with substantial reputations and were able to place key staffers in important positions in the respective presidential campaigns barilleaux notes
 dan quayle has no friends in a bush white house except george bush barilleaux says
theyre going to give him a lot of window dressing a space council drug task force but hes going to be a man on the outside  not a man whos going to be consulted in a crisis except on a pro forma basis
but eddie mahe jr a gop consultant who worked with the bush campaign says bush is likely to give quayle a more active role in the administration than he had in the campaign
democrats portrayed quayle during the campaign as a lightweight a man with little or no legislative accomplishments untested and unqualified to be a heartbeat away from the presidency
quayle didnt help his case by making a number of celebrated gaffes during the campaign perhaps the worst being his garbled explanation of the holocaust and his declaration i didnt live in this century
norman ornstein of the american enterprise institute says quayle while not the worlds leading intellectual is not a complete dummy
but quayle comes to the white house with a very damaging stereotype thats developed about him thats widely believed in the political community and thats believed by a large segment of the electorate ornstein says
both barilleaux and stephen hess of the brookings institution see parallels in quayles vice presidency and those of richard nixon and spiro agnew
the choice of nixon was viewed as a move by dwight eisenhower to appease the partys right wing and agnew was seen as a political nonentity
however quayle has four years to prove himself and i think youre going to see stories in two years about how much hes learned how much hes acted responsibly how far hes come from the campaign of 
he became more accessible to the media but continued to adhere to the schedule handed down from washington and to deliver the partys scripted message
and although he occasionally spoke out in frustration at having little control over his schedule and at ceasing to make national news he played the role of loyal no
that willingness to be a team player could serve him well in a bush white house mahe feels since bush wants a private adviser whose experience and opinion he respected  who has never had another agenda
dan quayle owes his political life to one man and one man alone mahe says
that joke was not only funny but it got to the heart of a strange phenomenon americans didnt give a damn about the vice presidency mike dukakis tried to make quayle a major issue and failed but some also felt that quayle wasnt qualified for a job that had no qualifications
so when quayle got to washington he got there with one goal support the president and make himself a very small target
we had asked him on the show a number of times christie basham senior producer of meet the press told me but he always declined
i asked david beckwith his spokesman why quayle had waited so long to go on a major interview show
the selection of dan quayle had been bushs first major and some would say only decision of his presidential campaign
many thought it was a terrible choice but there is nothing like a victory to give everything a rosy glow
and bushs announcement that quayle would be his running mate again was bushs way of saying i didnt screw up the first time
a typical example of a nonserious question often put to dan quayle is why does everyone say your wife is smarter than you
quayles questioners were david broder of the washington post and elizabeth drew of the new yorker both of whom stuck to serious questions
if quayle had been told the questioners were going to be hunter thompson and jimmy breslin i have a feeling quayle might have come down with laryngitis
during the  campaign i interviewed quayle and i came away with one overwhelming impression dan quayle would run for president in 
he is the most important person ever to come out of this town and even as the world considers his fitness for the presidency huntington is celebrating his life in what is ambitiously being billed as the premiere dan quayle memorabilia exhibit
 to those who say quayle does not merit his own exhibition quayle devotees say with a mixture of defiance and dignity that he is after all the vice president of the united states
 relatives former classmates and longtime neighbors of quayle have donated yearbooks report cards poems letters his little league uniform a coffee cup he drank from a chair he once stood on during the  presidential campaign and just about anything else he ever touched wrote signed or posed for
 the exhibition which runs through may  was put together by the dan quayle commemorative foundation a sort of fanclubturnedarchive devoted to documenting the life and times of the nations th and they say leastunderstood vice president
instead they measure news reports on him by their relative negativity describing the best coverage as more upbeat or halfway decent
 they defend the relatively young age of quayle who turned  in february all he needs is a little seasoning his limited experience look at what they said about truman  he was a haberdasher and his passion for golf he has to have some form of relaxation
 hes not the fool that the talk show hosts think he is says dottie watson president of the republican women of huntington county
if he would slow down talk an octave lower and think about what hes saying i dont think people would take him the way they do said jean anne drabenstot the owner of nicks kitchen quayles favorite restaurant
 hayden schenkel chairman of the huntington county democratic party and a distant cousin of david schenkel says some people would shudder and shiver if he accidentally became president of the united states
most of the democrats and even some of the republicans would say theyre tickled to death to have him as vice president and theyre  percent behind him
nonetheless most of huntingtons  residents have rallied around their native son for the exhibition which tracks his life from infancy through law school from the senate to the vice presidency
 the free exhibition has turned a gray room in the towns public library into a virtual dan quayle museum
 there is dan quayle and his brother chris riding horseback and wearing cowboy hats or sitting in front of the fireplace in their pajamas at christmas
there is dan quayle with his vacation bible school class dan quayle with the high school golf team dan quayle at  or  years of age with sharon mceachern when they were named king and queen of the swim festival at the fort wayne country club
for example his father james signed the report cards when dan brought home poor grades and his mother signed when he brought home good ones
dan wrote this rather thoughtful verse on nov   when he was  years old my dad is very very nice but he is not made of sugar and spice
 the exhibit also includes the  newspaper announcement of dan and marilyn quayles wedding the wooden quayle  quayle shingle the couple hung when they opened their law practice here and assorted campaign souvenirs including the official air sickness bag from the  republican national convention
it has already organized a walking tour of historic quayle sites like the white ranchstyle house where he spent his early days and nicks kitchen where he likes to order tenderloins fries and a milkshake
 we want everybody to know hes a winner  i dont care what the newspapers say said marge hiner one of the exhibit organizers
what a role model for our children to know that you can be a normal person come from a normal family and become vice president of the united states
checkpoint charlie the famed allied border crossing by the berlin wall was to be hauled away friday
lorn walsh late thursday stood sentry for the last time by the little white shack rendered unnecessary by the thaw in eastwest relations
this is a nice way to end my military service  to be here when they take it down said walsh  a military police officer who leaves the army in six weeks to study for the priesthood
a huge crane hung over the small house in the middle of the narrow street that leads to east berlin where a sign in english german russian and french says you are now leaving the american sector
secretary of state james a baker iii soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze and their colleagues from france britain and the two germanys were to preside over a ceremony marking the checkpoints removal friday
the envoys from the german states and the four world war ii allies that divided them were in east berlin to discuss the international aspects of german unification
since east germany overthrew its communist government last fall and the german borders were opened checkpoint charlie has become as superfluous as the crumbling berlin wall
with huge sections of the berlin wall being ripped down daily us officials decided two weeks ago to remove checkpoint charlie
the border crossing was the scene of stirring escapes and heartbreaking captures as east germans tried flee to the west breaking through east german control stations just  yards away from the allied checkpoint
east germans once manned their side of the checkpoint with emotionless effiency closely scrutinizing travel documents and creating a palpable tension
thursday night they merely waved westerners through their side of the checkpoint although some tourists demanded their documents be checked
soldiers from three nations locked the doors of checkpoint charlie today and a crane whisked away the cold war relic that symbolized a divided world
a us army band played a stirring song about old berlin as the rectangular white sentry station a place east germans died trying to reach was hoisted onto a truck for its passage into history
the famed allied checkpoint by the berlin wall was closed with an elaborate ceremony that brought together the top diplomats from the germanys and the four world war ii allies
for  years checkpoint charlie embodied the cold war us secretary of state james a baker iii told a crowd of invited guests and journalists on berlins friedrich street
baker soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze and the foreign ministers from france britain and the two germanys each heralded the end of the checkpoint as a symbol of change
shevardnadze called for the removal of berlins status as an alliedcontrolled city and the withdrawal of troops within six months after the two german states unify which could come in december
the proposal as translated into english by the soviets and distributed later to news media apparently would also include the kremlins soldiers stationed just outside the city proper
berlin has been split into soviet us british and france sectors and west berlin remains technically separate from west germany
the german and allied foreign ministers are meeting in east berlin to discuss the status of the city and a united germanys role in world affairs
large sections of the berlin wall are being dismantled daily and us officials decided to time the removal of checkpoint charlie with the foreign ministers meeting
a color guard of french british and american soldiers strode to the building and locked the doors leading to each allied nations compartment in the checkpoint
checkpoint charlie stood just  yards from an east german checkpoint and was the only place between the berlins that could be crossed on foot by nongermans
the ceremony was closed to the public but not to the residents of the buildings that line friedrich street which had been divided by the berlin wall since 
illa wobig leaned out her window and watched the ceremony unfold just  yards below the fourthfloor apartment where she has lived for  years
east german construction worker andreas bratke was working near the wall in january  when he suddenly bolted through the east german checkpoint down friedrich street and through checkpoint charlie
the soviet union said today that a united germany can join nato after a fiveyear transition period during which all soviet and us troops would leave the country
the proposal was outlined by soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze during international talks in east berlin on the strategic future of a united germany
the remarks a copy of which were obtained by the associated press indicates that a united germany would be free to join the western nato alliance after a fiveyear transitional period
but in exchange western and soviet troops would pull out of the country and germanys own military strength would be sharply reduced according to the proposal
shevardnadze made the proposal as he met with us secretary of state james a baker iii and their counterparts from britain france and the two german states
a us official speaking on condition of anonymity said us officials objected to the fiveyear time limit before germany could join nato
the united states wants a united germany to be a member of the north atlantic treaty organization and the soviet union has been staunchly opposed
shevardnadze said the soviet proposal seeks to limit the strength of the german armed forces and to revamp their structure to make sure that they are rendered incapable for offensive operations
it also said that within six months of unification all western troops should leave west berlin which remains technically under military occupation by the united states france and britian
the four nations would reduce their military forces in the country during a threeyear period following unification first by  percent then bring them down to a level of token contingents or completely withdraw them from germany
there are about  soviet troops in east germany while a quartermillion us troops are stationed in west germany along with tens of thousands of british and french soldiers
previously the soviets had said their troops would stay in what is now east germany for several years but had left unclear the exact plans for pulling them out
shevardnadze speaking earlier at a ceremony for the removal of the western allies checkpoint charlie said he wanted the big four powers troops out of greater berlin within six months after unification
the proposal as translated into english by the soviets and distributed to the news media apparently would also include the kremlins soldiers stationed just outside the city proper
an official reached by telephone in the office of the military attache at the soviet embassy in east berlin said there were no soviet troops stationed in the city proper
what they all had in common was a little white shack on the west side of the berlin wall a guardhouse with a funny name that stood as a chilling symbol of the tensions that divided a street a city a nation the world
checkpoint charlie the famed allied border crossing on the west side of the berlin wall was lifted into the sky by a giant crane friday placed gently onto a flatbed truck and consigned to history
it was emptied locked and taken away in an elaborate ceremony attended by six foreign ministers a brace of generals a brass brand and hundreds of reporters
french maj gen francois lann barked to a young american officer who crisply led away the last contingent of military police
the public was not invited to the ceremony on friedrich street the avenue blocked by checkpoint charlie and its oncefeared east german counterpart nearby
she is not sure if one of the people she saw was andreas bratke a yearold east berlin construction worker
tunnels balloons customized vehicles and other elaborate methods were used to flee past the berlin wall by desperate east germans
patrick gainey was coming back from a party when he saw a huge commotion near checkpoint charlie
this guy had driven a cement truck with his girlfriend and baby through the checkpoint said gainey a us army photographer
i was with the state security said polster  as he genially waved tourists through the east german checkpoint that is expected to follow checkpoint charlie into oblivion
the stonefaced scrutiny of the east german border guards helped give checkpoint charlie its chilling cachet
with the wall being dismantled daily in anticipation of german unification us officials decided to remove checkpoint charlie with a grand flourish
secretary of state james a baker iii soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze and their counterparts from france britain and the two germanys presided over the ceremony
eilli wiechies  watched the pageantry from his wheelchair on the sidewalk in front of his apartment house one of the few regular people allowed on the grounds
a us army band played that is the berlin atmosphere a stirring old song about the old berlin as the white checkpoint building was lifted to within  feet of mrs wobigs window
checkpoint charlie the berlin wall border post that symbolized the cold war was hoisted into history today
as a brass band played and foreign ministers of the four world war ii allies watched a crane lifted the prefabricated hut with its american british and french flags and placed it on a flatbed truck to be taken to a museum
checkpoint charlie went up in  in the middle of the friedrichstrasse boulevard after communist east germany erected the berlin wall to choke off a flood of refugees to the enclave of west berlin
the checkpoint symbolized our conviction as allies that berlin should remain one city and travel within it should be free british foreign secretary douglas hurd said in a speech
we always hoped that one day checkpoint charlie would no longer be needed and now that day has arrived
soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze attended the ceremony in a gesture of reconciliation with the western members of the wartime alliance britain france and the united states
shevardnadze the first soviet foreign minister to visit west berlin noted that the checkpoint was vanishing on the th anniversary of the nazi invasion of the soviet union
the closing of this checkpoint offers further proof of a turn for the better in the international arena for overcoming the legacy of confrontation he said
foreign ministers hansdietrich genscher of west germany and markus meckel of east germany also attended the ceremony
genscher thanked moscow for reform policies that had ended a time of trouble in berlin and opened the door to unity
hundreds of excited berliners leaned from balconies and windows today to cheer charlies exit snapping pictures and clapping in rhythm with the band as the crane pried the hut from its moorings and swung it away
former west german chancellor willy brandt who emotionally challenged the building of the wall as mayor of west berlin in the early s was in the front row of an invited audience
john major endorsed by margaret thatcher as the politician closest to her heart was elected by the conservative party tuesday night to succeed her as prime minister
major  fell two votes short of winning a majority in voting among the  coservative party members of parliament but his two opponents quickly conceded defeat and the party confirmed major as the winner
mrs thatcher ending  years in power intended to submit her resignation to queen elizabeth ii on wednesday morning and major would then be called to lead the government
major the chancellor of the exchequer emerged from his official residence at  downing st tuesday night smiling and holding hands with his wife norma
inside mrs thatcher who came next door from the prime ministers  downing street residence embraced major
i am thrilled and delighted that john major is to succeed me the iron lady said in a statement released by aides
it is a very exciting thing to become leader of the conservative party and particularly exciting i think to follow one of the most remarkable leaders the conservative party has ever had major said
we are going to unite totally and absolutely and were going to win the next general election said major who will be the youngest british prime minister in this century
the party had been torn by the sudden and unexpected leadership challenge by heseltine who last week stopped mrs thatcher short of victory in the first round of the leadership race
mrs thatcher had not wanted to leave office but she decided to resign last week after she was unable to put down heseltines challenge
major and foreign secretary douglas hurd both joined the race but before the vote her aides spread the word that she was backing major
the son of a circus performer and at one time a welfare recipient major personifies the values of selfreliance and hard work that mrs thatcher had preached to the nation
his election climaxed a month of british politicsturnedupside down and the western worlds longestserving head of government was driven from office by a revolt in party ranks
heading a government that was trailing the opposition labor party in the polls and suffering a losing streak in local parliamentary elections mrs thatcher lost control of events after her deputy sir geoffrey howe resigned on nov 
howe the fourth cabinet member to resign because of disputes over policy toward the european community shocked the house of commons on nov  by calling mrs thatcher a threat to britains vital interests
six days later with mrs thatcher at a nation summit in paris officially ending the cold war heseltine polled enough votes to deny her reelection as leader
john major is a thatcherette  that is how he sought election and that is how he got elected said labor party leader neil kinnock
it means that the policies that brought the poll tax recession heavy mortgages and rising unemployment will go on
during his fiveday campaign major had aaid he would review the poll tax an unpopular local tax brought in by mrs thatcher but he gave no other hints of differing with her
while adopting a gentler tone on the contentious issue of britains involvement in europe he shares her opposition to a single european currency and shares her belief in tight restraint on government spending
majors victory ended a patient fouryear campaign by heseltine to promote himself as a future leader of the party
by the weekend opinion polls showed that major was nearly as highly regarded by the public as was heseltine who has been prominent for a decade
major attracted support from figures on the right wing of the conservative party although his friends insisted majors own views were more liberal than many supposed
washington february  xinhua  us president bill clinton trying to brush aside recent differences with london today stressed washingtons special transatlantic relationship with britain
welcoming british prime minister john major in pittsburgh where majors grandfather and father once lived clinton said at the airport were working together today to respond to the terrible tragedy in bosnia to try to bring an end to the killing and to bring peace and to keep that conflict from spreading
for his part major said pressure would be increased for the peace that every sensitive person wishes to see in that wartorn and troubled land
on russia major said a russia thats a good neighbor to the united states and west would be one of the finest things that this generation could hand down to the next
major will spend a night at the white house the first foreign head of state to have this honor since clinton became president
on tuesday  march the two leaders will begin their discussions on a wide range of issues including russia bosnia northern ireland and the world trade
clinton and major will meet again in june in europe during the commemoration of the th anniversary of dday of the second world war
major said clinton would visit britain and perhaps the oxford university clintons alma mater during the june visit
cabinet ministers rallied behind john major yesterday by insisting there would be no leadership election this autumn
but the concerted show of support failed to dispel doubts among tory mps about his chances of staying in office
rightwing mps confirmed the findings in an independent on sundaynop national opinion poll poll that michael heseltine was the favourite to replace mr major if he is forced out
some of mr majors closest allies were seething with anger at mr heseltine and kenneth clarke the chancellor for posturing before the damaging retreat last week by the prime minister over britains veto powers in the enlarged european union
the leadership is hoping that over the easter recess the conservative constituencies will urge their mps to stop the damaging infighting which they believe is overshadowing the governments fightback on the economy law and order and education
that message was reinforced by three cabinet ministers who broke their easter sundays to support mr major
lord wakeham leader of the house of lords used a letter to his former constituency of colchester south to issue a general call to tories for loyalty to mr major
our support for him should not only be loyalty to a proven winner but also backing for a man who has ideas ambitions and ability to take britain to success in the st century lord wakeham said
however tory right wingers said last night that they would support mr major because there was no credible rightwing candidate
if a challenge does take place they will press mr portillo to stand to secure key commitments including no british entry into a single european currency
three of the tory mps who have been rumoured as possible stalking horses  teresa gorman tony marlow and sir richard body  appeared to rule themselves out
the prime minister told journalists at his huntingdon conservative club at the weekend that he would not be forced out by the speculation
in local government elections across britain yesterday the conservatives suffered their worst defeat ever losing control of  regional councils and  seats
as the ruling party the tories took just  percent of the vote two percentage points lower than their rating in the polls
the results of the local elections showed that the tories were reduced to the third party nationally behind the liberal democrats and the labour party
the labour party controls  local councils whereas the conservatives only control  with a sharp contrast in strength between the two sides
even some former conservative members of parliament announced publicly to reporters that they would vote for the liberal democrats
of course this was a measure taken by tories under circumstances of an inevitable defeat to reduce losses by encouraging constituents who resent the tories to vote for the liberal democrats rather than labour
they resent john majors leadership and would most willingly link majors incompetence and lack of vision with the bitter defeat in the local elections
even before all of the results were known some tories openly announced their determination to challenge john majors position and remove him from office as early as possible
the rightwinger michael portillo added salt to the wound by starting a dispute over the european issue and highlighted john majors image as a loser who fails to command
obviously all of these actions were long planned and are aimed at making john major suffer an even greater defeat in the european parliament elections scheduled for  june
john major is someone who was propped up by mrs thatcher who supported appointing the mediocre john major as her successor when she was utterly isolated so that one day she would be able to pull strings from behind the scenes and continue to pursue the thatcher line
nevertheless people around john major seriously pushed him to betray thatchers doctrine while pursuing entirely new leftist policies and affecting john majors moves
john major has always been weak and powerless and vacillates to the left and to the right resulting in his own crisis of honor
on the european issue he stressed the imperative of maintaining the sovereignty cultural traditions and lifestyle of each country of the future european union while reflecting the islanders mind set
on the one hand he expressed the will to join the european family on the other he made one big stride closer to the right
while great skill is needed to have ones bread buttered on both sides john major has been relatively stupid in such circumstance
when expounding on such concepts he set out a campaign to return to basic values with an emphasis on citizen selfdiscipline taking social responsibility and obligations and being upright
however one scandal surfaced after another in his cabinet consequently british citizens saw how bombastic major could be and how he failed to know himself
for a long time john major has failed to resolve the economic crisis and has seriously jeopardized the interests of british people who have become poorer with each passing day and suffer from a high rate of unemployment
at this critical juncture john major went back on promises made during the election campaign by increasing valueadded tax on domestic fuel as a result things became even harder for the poor
as published john major has become an expert in making empty promises while constituents continue to scorn this dishonest prime minister
at a time when his reputation was waning he wanted to start an offensive in the arena of difficult world issues regardless of british national strength
this being the case he wanted to try his luck in bosnia as well as policy toward china however he was helpless in dealing with domestic economic issues which would only lead britain to an impasse
it will be difficult for john major to lead the tories in the next general election therefore news spread earlier this year that john major would be replaced
however if politicians from various factions compete for office by taking a laissezfaire attitude the tory unity will be jeopardized
this being the case a planned transfer of power especially the reorganization of the cabinet and the replacement of the party chairman is necessary
word has spread that john major wants chris patten to become conservative party chairman however this proposal was rejected
that should have been a party secret making public such an inside story would only provide evidence of political reality namely many conservatives did not agree to chris patten contending for this position
there are no grounds to allow a politician who has lost a previous electoral campaign to canvass votes in the next one under unfavorable electoral circumstances
that would only aggravate the torys poor image as a party which enjoys little public support and has few talents
in actual fact should john major set out such a line in appointing people that would only give more evidence of his poor ability insight and lack of judgment as well as his selfknowledge
work to seek a new leader will be conducted by veteran tories how can john major be qualified for such a task
one year ago tomorrow mr john major surprised everyone but himself by winning the general election
his honeymoon after a very personal victory was shortlived and now he begins the second year of his hardwon term as a deeply unpopular leader who has everything still to prove
the past  months have been hijacked by internal party differences over europe by the debacle surrounding uk withdrawal from the exchange rates mechanism of the european monetary system and by a continuing deep recession which has disappointed and alienated many traditional tory supporters in business
mr majors anniversary inevitably led yesterday to an outbreak of political pointscoring over the governments record
while mr tony newton leader of the commons conceded no one pretends that the last year has been easy he also claimed that much had been achieved
mr john smith the labour leader was joined by  frontbench colleagues in launching a counterattack involving a detailed and documented indictment of mr majors failures
tory allegiances in the business world have also been put under immense pressure though criticism over policy drift and inaction may soften as recession ends
yesterday sir michael angus president of the confederation of british industry remained cautious but volunteered if i were a betting man i would say we have the embryo of a recovery
mr major can take little comfort from the conclusion widespread among industrialists that his greatest achievement in the past year has been britains withdrawal from the erm  something which he resisted and over which in the end he had no control
most industrialists however find it hard to criticise mr major as an individual with many drawing a flattering parallel between his personal qualities and those of his predecessor
he still attracts gratitude for the election victory which was seen  despite subsequent problems for the economy  as the best result for business
but unlike the previous no  occupant he is seen as a weak leader with little vision and bereft of a clearly articulated political conviction
there is a general perception that important though britains future place in europe is the prime minister has been excessively preoccupied with community affairs and associated internal party ructions to the detriment of the domestic economy
many industrialists are pleased that mr major is now attempting to reshape economic strategy in favour of the manufacturing base

the revelation that john major is capable of candid blunt and salty language when talking offthe record to friendly journalists has surprised some people
it has even been suggested that the recording of the prime ministers conversation with michael brunson itns political editor in which major used a variety of four six and eightletter words to communicate his lack of fondness for certain colleagues may do him good
major is a gonner especially after this weeks revolt of the woodentops in the christchurch byelection where a conservative majority of  at last years general election was converted into a  majority for the liberal democrats
in the aftermath of christchurch where labour lost its deposit i wanted to provoke the two johns into a spot of real soulsearching

chauncey played by peter sellers utters only mundane sentiments in a halting monotone but this convinces the republican partys power brokers that he is a surefire winner
in an interview with farmers weekly a few days ago major disclosed an unknown fact his father was once a farmer
francis wheen of the guardian a keen student of majors mysterious past immediately rang  downing street which claimed that majors father farmed near bromsgrove in 
as wheen pointed out major was an unresponsive minus  years old at that time and  a minor point this  bromsgrove is not in shropshire
yet when i heard about this my mind immediately went back to an incident a few months ago when major visited pittsburgh centre of the us steel industry as part of his american tour
there are those who will argue that this merely means that major is a typical democratic politician that one who wants to become prime minister in a democracy must recognise many constituencies of interest not just one
margaret thatcher was notoriously dogmatic even in public and so too was edward heath even though he always pretended to be a consensus politician
no majors technique is very much his own invention very much a reflection of his own particular character itself a product of his unsettled family background

john major who was endorsed by prime minister margaret thatcher as her successor and heir was elected today as leader of the conservative party and will become prime minister
major fell two votes short of the needed majority but his opponents conceded defeat and conservative party officials declared him elected
major  her chancellor of the exchequer is the youngest person to be elected britains prime minister since the th century
it is a very exciting thing to become leader of the conservative party and particularly exciting i think to follow one of the most remarkable leaders the conservative party has ever had major said

we are going to unite totally and absolutely and were going to win the next general election said major who emerged smiling from his residence at  downing st major won  votes former defense secretary michael heseltine had  votes and foreign secretary douglas hurd had  votes in a secret ballot election among tory members of parliament
i congratulate john major and thank him for a firstclass campaign fought without rancor or bitterness which i believe lays the basis for the unity of our party heseltine said moments after the vote was announced
within minutes cranley onslow chairman of the conservative party committee that supervised the election announced that another ballot was not required and that major was elected
thatcher left her residence at  downing street to congratulate major who as chancellor of the exchequer is her nextdoor neighbor at no

john major the yearold chancellor of the exchequer who rose out of one of londons toughest neighborhoods and the unemployment line was selected tuesday as britains next prime minister
major whose father was once a circus trapeze artist was elected leader of the conservative party to replace margaret thatcher whose sudden resignation under pressure last week surprised the nation
thatcher formally presents her resignation today to queen elizabeth ii who will then ask major to form a new government
the conservatives choice of major a thatcher protege came after a battle pitting him against two other contenders for the party leadership former defense secretary michael heseltine and foreign secretary douglas hurd
the threeway race took shape last week when thatcher stunned by heseltines strong showing in the firstround voting for party leader resigned
in the secret secondround balloting among the  tory members of the house of commons on tuesday major got  votes  two shy of the total he needed for an outright victory
but as party members began preparing themselves for a thursday runoff between major and heseltine the runnerup both heseltine with  votes and hurd with  threw their support to major
thatcher said she was thrilled by majors victory adding that he was her personal favorite among the three contenders
his election ensures the unity of the fractured conservative party which now has become the favorite to defeat the opposition labor party in the next general election
 downing st next to the prime ministers major declared tuesday evening we are going to unite totally and absolutely and we are going to win the next election
it is a very exciting thing to become leader of the conservative party and particularly exciting i think to follow one of the most remarkable leaders the conservative party has ever had major said
when the results of tuesdays vote were announced about  pm both heseltine and hurd said that they would vote for major in the scheduled third runoff ballot on thursday and advised their supporters to do the same
party leaders however waived the third ballot  which was expected to be unanimous  and major was declared party leader

major is a high school dropout who made his name in banking before winning a seat in the house of commons in 
he has few enemies and is regarded as a leader who can unify the party and associates said tuesday night lead the tories to victory in the next election which must be held within  months at a time of the partys choosing
he is not expected to introduce any major new policies but will take a more sympathetic view toward britains role in the european community and has promised to review the controversial community charge the socalled poll tax introduced by thatcher
labor party leader neil kinnock who likely will face major in the next national election immediately labeled him more of the same in the thatcher mold
with  votes in the threeway race major did not gain as many as the  votes thatcher won nov  when heseltine was her sole opponent
that vote  while she was in paris attending the summit meeting of the conference on security and cooperation in europe  forced her into a runoff with heseltine and ultimately cost her the party leadership
but in that vote under the partys complicated rules she needed a majority plus  and she fell four votes short
the prime ministers downfall came after she had run into a stretch of unpopularity  partly through her authoritarian manner partly because of inflation and high interest rates and partly because of her unpopular new poll tax
she also appeared to take an antieuropean attitude toward her  partners in the european community which caused her longserving cabinet colleague and deputy prime minister geoffrey howe to resign and deliver a witheringly critical resignation speech
that speech led heseltine who had walked out of the cabinet in  in a dispute over how to aid of a defense contractor to challenge thatcher for the leadership in that first ballot last tuesday
her closest advisers reported that her support in the house of commons was eroding friends said so she decided to resign rather than risk the humiliation of a defeat at the hands of one of her own colleagues
at that point on thursday morning both major and hurd loyal members of her cabinet entered the race against heseltine
many tories in parliament were angry at heseltine for his role in bringing down thatcher who had won three national elections during her  years as conservative party leader
her confrontational style of leadership won her many admirers at home and abroad  and many enemies here and in the european community
during the past few days major picked up strength among his colleagues as opinion polls showed him to be the next most popular tory after heseltine nationwide
some commentators feared that thatchers revelation of her choice might harm major  with her comment tuesday morning that she would make a good backseat driver
but major was the clearcut victor in the balloting held from  am to  pm tuesday in a house of commons committee room
to lay the basis for unity he said he would ask his supporters to vote for major in the expected third ballot on thursday as he himself would do
a third ballot seemed certain until cranley onslow who heads the conservative party organization called the  committee which supervised the party election announced that another ballot would not be necessary and declared major the party leader
it was not immediately clear whether hurd and heseltine would join majors cabinet though majors aides indicated they would be offered roles in the government
conservative party members of all hues were elated by the result and by the fact that the short campaign was conducted in the most gentlemanly fashion with no blood on the floor
the labor party almost overnight went from being the strong favorite in the next election to second place behind a tory party led by major

british prime minister john major said today that iraqi troops will have to be forcibly removed from kuwait if president saddam hussein does not agree to withdraw them peacefully
major just as unyielding in talking about hussein as was his predecessor margaret thatcher rejected the notion that a partial iraqi pullback from kuwait would help bring about a solution to the crisis
a complete withdrawal is necessary a partial withdrawal wont do major said in a display of solidarity with us policy on the persian gulf
on the gulf issue at least majors remarks augured well for his talks with president bush late in the day at camp david the maryland presidential retreat where the two leaders were planning an overnight stay
major who arrived here thursday night for a hour visit wasted no time in going on a rhetorical offensive against hussein using a succession of four television interviews aired shortly after dawn
if he stays in kuwait in a country which essentially at the moment is rather like a prison camp a country that hes dismantling day after day then he will have to be forcibly removed major said
at the same time major demonstrated the kinder gentler face he has brought to british politics since his accession showing none of the abrasiveness that was a thatcher hallmark
comparing major and thatcher one us official said the biggest change is personal style
three decades ago a west german politician said german reunification was a sleeping lioness that would awake one day with a mighty roar
now there is growing speculation the awakening may be at hand to create a giant political and economic machine that could dominate europe
reunification is coming closer but i cant say whether it will take   or  years says west german conservative lawmaker eduard lintner
the daily sight of thousands of refugees fleeing east german leader erich honeckers hardline communist rule for the capitalist west has revived international interest in the debate
once dismissed as a nostalgic daydream the idea of german reunification has gotten a public nod from president bush and something short of a categorical no from president mikhail s gorbachev of the soviet union
if there were a free choice under the present circumstances in the german democratic republic east germany certainly  percent to  percent would vote for national reunification with the federal republic of germany added the yearold lintner in an associated press interview
the west german constitution calls for a united germany but it has not been a paramount concern of the west germans in the years since the ruins of nazi germany were divided into east and west at the end of world war ii
full national reunification would completey rework the postwar european order mapped out by the conquering allies
londons prestigious sunday times on sept  mapped out a possible scenario that includes massive troop reductions in europe honeckers death and further westernization of poland and hungary
moscow unilaterally abolishes the warsaw pact after guarantees from poland and hungary they will not join other alliances the times futuristic view continued
west germany withdraws from nato and a referendum in both east and west germany votes for reunification and neutrality
that sort of talk is being heard more and more as moscow loosens its hold on the east bloc and countries like the soviet union poland and hungary explore democratic reforms
the implications of pulling down the berlin wall and other barriers to link the two german states are enormous and for many ominous
as much of western europe heads towards its own unification in  the economic center of gravity would be shifted even further to the german side with a powerhouse of nearly  million people   million west germans and  million east germans
west germany is already europes largest exporting nation and despite its many flaws east germanys economy is the envy of many soviet bloc neighbors
a unified germany could become the political focal point of a continent already in flux as democratic movements sweep parts of the soviet bloc
older generations recall eerie echoes of nazi dictator adolf hitlers boasting that he had brought about the unity of the german nation
eva kulesza head of research for the soviet union and eastern europe at the french institute of international relations says she believes that as far as public opinion there is new sort of mistrust toward germany
since west germany and east germany are at the front lines of two competing alliances any signs for eventual reunification would have to come from washington and moscow
during a news conference last week in montana bush said that reunification is a matter for the germans to decide
for his part gorbachev evaded the issue during a news conference in bonn in june saying only the situation in europe today was determined by historical realities
in thinking about the german question we ought not to be governed by old prejudices and outofdate assumptions wrote commentator peter jenkins in londons the independent
the cold war was conducted in the name of freedom and today if the coming of freedom to east germany brings a desire for unity which finds its echo in the federal republic we ought not to be opposed
willy brandt the social democrat who sought greater ties to the east as chancellor in the s said german unity doesnt necessarily mean a single state although he called reunification a hypothesis that cannot be excluded
as talk grows in the west the positions against reunification almost seem to harden in east germany as people leave the country in nearrecord numbers

little is likely to change in east germany as long as the yearold honecker and his aging comrades stay in power

the calls for reunification have already found a sympathetic ear among some leaders of the polish solidarity movement in the country that suffered some of the nazis most brutal savagery
after all the abnormal situation of the german nation overshadows the whole of polishgerman relations member of parliament adam michnik wrote on monday in the prosolidarity daily newspaper gazeta wyborcza which he edits

the concept of a reunified germany enjoys support from the united states and other countries but some analysts believe the consequences of a political and economic german superstate could have an unsettling effect throughout europe
the lifting of travel restrictions by east germany on thursday has breathed new life into the idea of a single german state drawing expressions of support from the bush administration and others
but soviet affairs expert william hyland says that despite these assertions a reunified germany is really terrifying to most of the countries involved to the west germans to the united states soviet union poland and czechoslovakia
no one really wants german unity except the east german people and they turn out to be the decisive factor says hyland a onetime top aide to former secretary of state henry a kissinger
it was just  months ago when ceremonies were held commemorating the th anniversary of the start of world war ii a time when a unified germany initiated what was to become the slaughter of more than  million people

the official us policy on the reunification question was outlined last thursday by state department deputy spokesman richard boucher
reunification has been supported by nato and by the united states for  years and our strongly held view is that reunification or reconciliation between the peoples of germany must take place in peace and freedom he said

theodore sorenson a top aide to president john f kennedy when the berlin wall was built in  says he hopes a reunited germany will be forged as part of a reunited europe
reunification sorenson says will pose problems because we couldnt afford to have a reunited germany outside the western alliance
thats why i hope it will be a reunited europe within which the reunited germany can take place sorenson says
rogers notes that soviet president mikhail gorbachev has said the nations of eastern europe can do what they want so long as they stay in the warsaw pact
if east germany stays in the warsaw pact nato with the best of its ability would try to prevent full reunification maybe a confederation between the two germanys but not a full reunification rogers says
senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine points out that german reunification is a sensitive question for the soviets
soviet policy is based upon preventing a reunified economically strong and certainly militarily strong germany mitchell says
there must be some serious apprehension in the soviet union today because the events of the last couple of days certainly has made reunification more likely
the bush administration says it does not foresee the dismantling of nato under any circumstances but according to hyland the reunification of germany could mean the demise of the alliance
it may also mean the end of western european unity because both have been based on a divided germany and a divided europe hyland says
if that comes to an end and  million germans are united in a confederation or a single state it changes the entire map of europe
chancellor helmut kohl assured visiting us senators on the eve of a superpower summit that west germany will not forsake nato to reunite with east germany one of the senators said friday

asked whether he thought the west germans were committed to staying in the nato military alliance of western nations the indiana republican said without any reservations
there is growing discussion in west germany about german reunification as a result of sweeping social and political reforms underway in east germany
there has been speculation that west germany might someday be tempted to agree to neutrality if the kremlin stipulates it as the price for reunification
but the soviets who suffered millions of deaths fighting a unified germany in world war ii have said the idea of german reunification is dangerous and unrealistic
president bush and soviet president mikhail s gorbachev are to begin a shipboard summit off malta on saturday
the dramatic events in east germany and whirlwind reforms elsewhere in the east bloc are likely to be a main topic of their talks

the senators also met with foreign minister hansdietrich genscher and defense minister gerhard stoltenberg during the day
lugar said kohl told the americans that reunification would be a procedure that depends on many events in germany and europe and that the soviet union and the united states have a role to play

sweeping democratic reforms have taken hold in east germany in the past several weeks under the pressure of mass protests spurring talk of reuniting the two german states divided at the end of world war ii
west germany has proposed a plan for greater unity but east german leaders reject reunification
the specter of a powerful reunited germany has troubed many poles especially the older ones who recall the  nazi invasion of poland that began world war ii
a reported surge in antipolish sentiment in east germany in recent weeks has heightened polish anxieties
skubiszewskis speech seemed designed to reassure poles that the government does not see unification in the near future and will insist on polands current borders
skubiszewski faulted west german chancellor helmut kohls program for gradual german reunification offered last week for not making clear that reunification would respect the existing border between poland and east germany
some rightwing west german politicians have called for recovering the  square miles of territory that germany lost to poland at the end of world war ii
east germany and west germany each separately has recognized the border but there has been no official assurance that a reunified germany would also acknowledge the border
he also said german reunification is unlikely as long as west germany belongs to nato and east germany to the sovietled warsaw pact military alliance
the communist party today admitted that east germanys socialist system has failed and expressed support for a type of partnership with west germany
the statement in the communist party newspaper neues deutschland was one of the bluntest official assessments to date of the countrys increasingly troubled situation
it came a day after shouting matches broke out over german reunification during prodemocracy protests in leipzig and dresden
also today secretary of state james a baker iii urged caution on the reunification issue
he visited the berlin wall and met with west german chancellor helmut kohl and east german premier hans modrow
in another development the largest opposition movement new forum announced it will take part as a political party in the countrys first free elections scheduled for may 
neues deutschland in proposing a new party platform said socialism has definitely failed as a social system in our country and acknowledged that the popular revolutionary movement of the past weeks had led to the scrapping of the old system
the paper repeated the communists promise to work for a new democratic socialism within a multiparty system
during the past few weeks both germanys have increased business and cultural ties but have debated what labels to use for closer relations since the east berlin government rejects calls for reunification
neues deutschland urged a qualified partnership of both german states but rejected any suggestions of resolving the german question
during mondays demonstrations that drew more than  protesters the largest of them the nowweekly rally in the southern city of leipzig speakers warned that the reunification issue could fracture the popular movement that has forced the ruling communists into swift retreat

adn said  people demonstrated for reunification in karlmarxstadt while several thousand people split into pro and antireunification groups at a rally in dresden
the rallies came shortly after the four victorious world war ii allies met in west berlin to discuss the latest developments in east germany and berlin  the divided city that they still technically administer
the meeting brought together officials of the united states france and britain with soviet officials who have increasingly expressed concern over calls in both germanys to reunite the country

soviet president mikhail s gorbachev during a central committee in moscow on saturday urged the west not to try to influence developments in east germany
adn said gorbachev would meet soon with gregor gysi a reformer who was chosen east german communist party chief on saturday

president mikhail s gorbachev met tuesday with east german premier hans modrow and appeared to be more open toward eventual german reunification
modrow told reporters after the meeting that gorbachev did not rule out such a prospect in the future and at the same time did not venture to set some time limits for that
earlier the kremlin chief said any such decisions must include the four allied powers and take into account european opinions
the development of events in the world in east germany in the soviet union demand deep consideration and an analytical approach to deciding this problem he said in remarks reported by the official news agency tass
tass said gorbachev emphasized that talks about restructuring relations between the two germanys must involve all directly interested governments
asked by an east german correspondent about his attitude toward reunification gorbachev said the question was not unexpected and that no one can cast doubt on the reasonableness of asking it
for the first time the communists acknowledged german unity as a longterm goal but said it must be imbedded in the process of overcoming europes overall divisions
the soviet union traditionally has strongly opposed any talk of german reunification but gorbachev has softened that position in adopting a policy that has allowed radical reform in eastern europe
gorbachev in comments to reporters after meeting french president francois mitterrand in kiev in december reiterated his view that the existence of two german states is a fact based on the outcome of world war ii
but he added the present situation is the result of specific historical events a specific historical process on this continent
a different approach may create a situation that would complicate the entire european process including the relations between the two german states gorbachev said
modrow said the two germanys could work toward confederation in phases with no time limit
according to tass the soviet leader said any action on reunification must not infringe on the interests of either east or west germany the four allied powers france britain the united states or the soviet union or anyone else in europe

disgraced former communist party leader erich honecker was released from prison tuesday night after justice officials determined he was too frail to withstand the rigors of imprisonment while awaiting trial on treason charges
gorbachev said tuesday in moscow that he believed one germany was likely in the future but he added that germans should not decide this important question on the streets
in west germany foreign minister hansdietrich genscher told west german radio that gorbachev had correctly analyzed the situation and again shown his political skill
west german officials and media praised gorbachevs view as realistic and described it as an important sign of hope for east germans who have lost faith in their government
communist leaders launched their uphill campaign for march  parliamentary elections with a news conference to unveil their european concept that aims for a united and demilitarized europe
party ideologist peter brie said the communists support the togetherness of the german nation and urged a thoughtful and measured approach to reunification
in an interview with the west german bild newspaper party leader gregor gysi complained that the reunification drive is moving too quickly
the reunification issue promises to dominate the election campaign that will seat a new leadership in less than seven weeks
increasing numbers of east germans have demonstrated for union with wealthy and prosperous west germany as their own economy tumbles and an exodus of skilled workers continues unchecked
more than  people fled east germany last year having lost hope that their spartan living conditions would improve
the communists are widely distrusted because of corruption scandals that have surfaced since the peaceful prodemocracy revolt last fall and because they carry the blame for leading east germany into its current economic and political crises
the man most blamed for the countrys problems honecker was set free after an east berlin court rejected a request that he be kept in prison until his trial in march
the court decided that despite the severity of the charges against honecker the state of the accuseds health does not permit imprisonment the official adn news agency reported
about  east germans many carrying west german flags demonstrated saturday for speedy german reunification the official east german news agency adn said

the chairman of the simon wisenthal center has asked to meet with the leaders of west and east germany to discuss the great fear that german reunification brings to the community of victims of nazism
i must tell you i am not among those in the cheering section applauding the rush towards german reunification rabbi marvin hier wrote chancellor helmut kohl of west germany and prime minister hans modrow of east germany
hier is the founder of the center headquartered in los angeles which seeks to keep alive the memory of the nazi persecution of jews in germany and naziconquered lands
in nearly identical letters he asked to meet with kohl during his forthcoming trip to washington and with modrow in germany next month
you are undoubtedly aware he wrote both leaders of the great fear that german reunification brings to the community of victims of nazism
it is not an irrational fear of the kind that one explains away as the nightmares of victims who remain locked into their past and lose all perspective of present reality
the fears are real because those who bear the scars of the last unified germany do not see their concerns being addressed in the current reunification discussions betwen world leaders
among them were a program to teach german schoolchildren about the annhilation of the jews the creation of an agency to monitor and prosecute hate groups the continuation of the special relationship now existing between west germany and israel the convening of a  conference of world leaders on the th anniversary of the conference at which the final solution was developed the establisment of a german commission to protect holocaust sites the banning of terrorist organizations that have enjoyed respectablity in east germany a cultural exchange program between german and jewish organizations german television and radio programs on the reconciliation restitution payments to the families and victims of nazism and a german commitment to revitalize former synagogues in east german territory
historians say the world need not fear that german jackboots will echo again on european pavements but some still see the rush toward german reunification as a setback  a step away from the integration of europe
for the most part the historians say an east germany collapsing into chaos represents a greater threat to stability than a united german state
the west germans are moving ahead not out of nationalistic fervor but a perceived need to deal with a crisis said henry ashby turner of yale author of the two germanies since 
i dont think there is any chance that the young men of germany are going to slip out of their adidas running shoes and pull on jackboots and start running around saying heil
he was one of several experts in german history discussing the implications of reunification following the decision tuesday by the four world war ii allies  the united states britain france and the soviet union  to accept the reunification of a germany they divided  years ago
university of chicago historian michael geyer a native of germany said he feared the creation of a strong sovereign nation in the center of europe could reverse a more important development  the year drive toward an integrated europe in which industries banks trade unions and even government ministries have been collaborating across borders
the result of a dominant uncomfortably strong german state geyer added could be a setback to the diminishment of national borders
it could also mean he said that american troops might have to stay in europe as a counterweight to germany
if i had my druthers reunifications would have happened after  after the integration of the west german economy into the economy of western europe said charles j herber of george washington university expressing similar concern
west germans were aware of their european neighbors misgivings said richard breitman of american university and so they presented reunification within the context of european integration
for all that breitman said one germany is not only inevitable but given the successful record of west germany over the last  years my feeling is it is better than having a regime in chaos
the only alternative to reunification added turner is an east germany in ruins a basket case a bangladesh of europe
gerhard weinberg of the university of north carolina considered a leading historian of the nazi era cautioned that reunification if mishandled could prove explosive
while the people of west europe have gotten over nationalistic distrusts east europeans living in closed societies have not he said and fear of germany is a reality in east europe and russia he said
i dont think the germans are heading for moscow again but we have to give people  and the germans have to give people  time to think this through and get used to it
mishandled reunification could scare one or the other of the participants into starting something and scare others and goodness knows where it would end
gordon craig emeritus professor at stanford said the division of germany has been the basis of a peace settlement which worked pretty well but was abnormal and sooner or later had to be corrected
german reunification said craig gives the world the chance to build a new international system one that will prevent the use of international violence
he added we have to be careful that we dont fall back into the kind of system that existed before the second world war a europe filled with nations that were suffering various grievances rivalries disputed frontiers driven by what they considered to be legitimate reasons but pitted against each other  the sort of things that gave rise to hitler in 
the berlin villa where the nazi leadership met to implement the final solution against europes jewish population will be the site of a world jewish congress conference on german reunification
the new yorkbased organization announced tuesday that the meeting is scheduled for may  the th anniversary of ve day
the world is expecting a jewish statement on reunification said edgar bronfman the president of the world jewish congress
i think that the place where they decided on the final solution is the right place to have such a meeting and the anniversary of the victory in europe seems to be the right day
some  members of the world jewish congress from about  countries will attend the conference at the villa in wannsee berlin where on jan   high german government and party officials adopted a plan to exterminate the jews
in the long run he said a united germany can be a very positive thing for europe but certain precautions must be taken to prevent a repeat of history
for example germanys borders must be sealed in cement and the country should not be allowed nuclear weapons he said
it will be the first meeting ever held on german soil by the world jewish congress which was founded in  in response to hitlers threats against jews
sir the argument for an independent central bank is that it should be free of party political interference not that it should conduct monetary policy without regard to national regional or global interests
whatever policy the kohl government followed over reunification it was bound to unleash a large federal deficit and inflationary pressures in germany
as the western german population is now aware german reunification needs a strong growing west german economy to finance the subsidisation of eastern germans living standards until there is a sustained upswing in the east  even if at the cost of higher german inflation than the bundesbank would wish
the governments of europe have been remarkably patient with the bundesbank although it is threatening nearly  years of european effort for greater economic and political integration
it is ironic that just when german reunification presented a shortterm reason for germany to shift its antiinflationary economic and monetary priorities accommodating european convergence bundesbank intransigence is threatening the emu commitment
but germany is the one economy which for reasons of reunification could afford a more relaxed stand on the inflationary front
yet mr otmar issing the bundesbanks chief economist advises there are no grounds for a cut in germanys interest rates
the german government might point out to the bundesbank that monetary targets might be achievable only at the cost of many more than m unemployed in germany of the destruction of the emu programme and global depression
the european currency bloc is overvalued against the dollar and yen as a result of bundesbank interest rate policies
a future europeanwide central bank must clearly  like the us federal reserve  be more accountable in the broader european political and economic interest
the governments and central banks of europe and the g block  including the kohl administration  should pressurise the bundesbank and be prepared to consider constitutional changes if necessary to halt this idiocy

west german chancellor helmut kohl declared on his return from moscow on sunday that the way is now free for german reunification
his meeting with soviet president mikhail s gorbachev convinced him he told west german radio that the two german states should enter into negotiations as quickly as possible after the march  east german election
kohl will meet with east german prime minister hans modrow on tuesday and wednesday in bonn to discuss immediate steps in economic cooperation including monetary union to prevent the collapse of the faltering east german economy
he said that immediate steps must be taken on the economic front to stop the hemorrhage of east germans to the federal republic and keep them in their heimat or home in east germany
kohl said that his talks with gorbachev  who told him that reunification is a matter for the germans themselves to decide  could lead to an economic breakthrough in east germany which in turn could provide a push forward for all of europe
asked how soon the two germanys could merge kohl declared that the march election has to come first and then i think it will all go very quickly
the chancellor said that almost all of the political parties and opposition groups in east germany now support reunification
gorbachev inquired about plans by west german politicians to campaign in east germany kohl said adding that the soviet leader did not appear to be upset about such political activity
west germanys social democratic party is expected to campaign heavily in east germany in support of a fledging branch of the party that has taken a surprisingly strong lead in public opinion polls
major members of the party including former chancellor willy brandt are scheduled to appear at rallies on behalf of the east german social democrats
with the surge of the east german social democrats political analysts are pointing to the strange role they could play in the ultimate political fate of kohl
ever since reunification became a blazing issue kohls standing in west german opinion polls has risen and if the national elections now scheduled for december were held today he would have a good chance of leading his christian democratic union to victory
but if the two germanys are fused before the west germany election in december the growing number of social democratic voters in what today is east germany  who would presumably be allowed to vote in december  could easily tip the balance away from the christian democrats pushing kohl out of the government leadership
the mass emigration of thousands of disaffected east germans has rekindled reunification talk in west germany where some legislators plan to begin exploring the possiblity of reuniting the two germanys
proponents acknowledge the risks of assuming too much of east bloc reform trends and most hedge their thoughts with careful references to washington and moscow
yet growing signs of ferment in east germany have given chancellor helmut kohls government reason to consider the possibilities
eduard lintner parliamentary speaker on german affairs for the joint christian democrat and christrian socialist caucus in the bundestag said his committee has placed reunification on its october agenda
he said the sessions which will include government officials and outside experts hopefully can devise reunification models to discuss with west germanys western allies particularly the us it has become clear to the world that the communist system in east germany is in trouble mr lintner said
the time has come for us to show our allies but also reformminded people in the east that german reunification is no longer just a theory but a subject requiring a serious appraisal of how it could come about
the us ambassador to bonn vernon a walters earlier this month reaffirmed washingtons policy of supporting a german reunification based on free democratic elections
but mr walters caused a stir by predicting that reunion could occur in the relatively near future
emerging opposition to uncompromising communist rule in east germany has raised questions on how long east berlins leaders can resist the democratic reforms sweeping through neighboring east bloc countries
reforms in poland hungary and even the soviet union have magnified east germanys stalinist controls
fledgling protest groups and the influential protestant church have begun pressing for reforms in east germany which if allowed to include free elections could eventually lead to a reunited germany according to some western experts
dorothee wilms bonns cabinet minister for intergerman affairs said in an interview in the newspaper welt am sonntag that recent polls show that between  and  of all west germans favor a reunifed germany
the desire for reunification a feeling of togetherness a sense of nationhood  all this has strongly increased in recent years ms wilms told the newspaper
the recent escape movement from the ddr makes especially clear that people of both german states want to live free amongst themselves she said but cautioned that reunification cannot occur overnight
most west german governments since  have paid only lip service to the reunification goal set down in the preamble of west germanys constitution
further many west german workers worry that a mass influx of east germans could threaten their jobs
thousands of east germans have emigrated to west germany over the austrohungarian border since budapest ignored east berlins protests and opened its border
close to  east german refugees have arrived in west germany so far this year either legally or by escaping and a total of more than  are expected by december
the soviets have joined east berlin in criticizing bonn for welcoming the east german refugees and chided hungary for violating an emigration treaty with east germany by allowing them to leave
moscow which has tolerated reforms elsewhere in the east bloc is said to be concerned by conditions in east germany perhaps the most important of its warsaw pact satellites
unconfirmed west german intelligence reports appearing in the west german media said moscow fears a growing dissident movement and mass demonstrations in east germany by next year
soviet president mikhail gorbachev accepted an invitation to attend east germanys th anniversary celebration providing an opportunity for serious discussions with erich honecker east berlins ailing party leader

two creeks just outside this ohio river village of  residents overflowed when thunderstorms dumped about  inches of rain thursday night in about an hour
the raging waters knocked homes off their foundations and washed away a bar filled with people in shadyside an appalachian foothill town
the shadyside fire department set up a command center at the jefferson elementary school to coordinate rescue efforts
command center spokeswoman karen bovek said officials had no complete death toll figure
shadyside  about  miles south of wheeling wva  is in belmont county a mostly hilly rural area in eastern ohio
acting mayor james amato said the storms created a deluge that knocked homes off their foundations

shadyside fire chief mark badia said rescuers pulled people from three cars in wegee creek which flows through shadyside and into the ohio river
about  residents were evacuated from their homes in central ohio after  inches of rain fell in an hour flooding streets and washing out rural roads
the death toll from flash floods that swept through a rural area of eastern ohio increased to  sunday as searchers dug along two creeks and dived into the ohio river
workers used shovels and picks to dig along the creek banks and sifted through debris at places marked with red flags where search dogs indicated they had detected human scents national guard capt
one body was found sunday in debris along wegee creek about three miles from where it meets the river said belmont county coroners investigator chuck vogt

the wegee and pipe creeks overflowed thursday night during storms that poured   inches of rain onto eastern ohio in   hours
authorities said friday that  people were missing some of those were later found dead while others notified authorities that they were safe
officials were comparing county property lists and data from the census bureau with information from residents and relatives boling said
investigators sunday blamed the flash floods on an unusually heavy rainstorm that overwhelmed the designed flow capacities of three bridges over the creeks

president corazon aquino has agreed to allow ferdinand marcos to return to the philippines so that the government can try him on charges of stealing billions of dollars newspapers said saturday
the manila bulletin and the manila chronicle quoted mrs aquinos press secretary teodoro benigno as saying that mrs aquino made the assurance to two swiss lawyers before she visited switzerland earlier this month
the reports did not say when criminal charges against marcos aquinos ousted predecessor will be filed or when mrs aquino will allow him to return
mrs aquinos government has said it will file criminal charges against marcos whom it has accused of stealing up to  billion in government funds
swiss lawyers are helping the philippine government trace money that marcos and his family allegedly placed in swiss bank accounts
marcos has been living in hawaii since he was toppled by the civilianmilitary revolt that swept mrs aquino to power in february 
the swiss government has frozen the assets of marcos and his associates and has not released information on them to the philippine government because of legal challenges posed by marcos lawyers and swiss banks
the unidentified swiss lawyers said the information will not be turned over unless and until there is an assurance that formal charges will be filed against him benigno was quoted as saying
mrs aquino has said she would allow marcos to return now only if he and his family swore allegiance to her government and returned the money he allegedly stole during his year rule
she said later she would abide by any court decision if marcos lawyers in the philippines raised the matter of his return to the courts
president corazon aquino said today she will not allow ferdinand marcos to come home to die and her government will not permit the ousted president to be buried on philippine soil
marcos wife imelda appealed today to mrs aquino to open her heart and allow the former president to return
marcos lawyer also asked the philippine supreme court to order the return pledging the ousted leader would cooperate with the aquino administration
marcos was reported in critical condition today in a honolulu hospital after undergoing emergency kidney surgery
hospital officials said the yearold former philippine leader was suffering from renal cardiac and pulmonary failure
in honolulu marcos aide arturo aruiza said imelda had left the hospital to make a final appeal to mrs aquino to allow her husband to die in his homeland

in a statement broadcast today by the promarcos radio station dzec imelda said she was trying to contact the presidential office to make a last appeal to madam corazon aquino to open her heart and let ferdinand come home because he is in very serious condition
mrs aquino told reporters earlier that she was sorry to hear that marcos condition had deteriorated and i pray that he will be able to recover
i regret to inform mrs marcos if indeed she is asking me for reconsideration because as i have said in the past much as i agree that mr marcos has his rights i still have to consider also the rights and interests of millions of filipinos mrs aquino said
i have already said in the past that we will not allow his remains to be brought back here and we have already taken plans to avoid any untoward incidents she added
in honolulu marcos aide arturo aruiza said mrs marcos planned to make one last appeal to mrs aquino to allow her husband to return home
rafael ileto mrs aquinos national security advisor said granting such a request was still an option but i doubt very much that it will be one of the solutions
ileto who met with mrs aquino for a halfhour today said marcos no longer posed a threat to the nation but his followers can cause disruptions of normal functions
ileto a retired vice chief of staff and former defense minister said the member armed forces was capable of quelling any unrest by marcos supporters
president corazon aquino on friday refused to allow ferdinand marcos to return home to die and said her government wont permit him to be buried here despite a last appeal from his wife
marcos wife imelda broadcast an appeal friday to mrs aquino to allow her husband to die in his homeland and his supporters threatened mass protests if the request is rejected
but mrs aquino refused to withdraw her ban on marcos and the philippine supreme court rejected a petition from the former presidents lawyer juan david to order the return
marcos has lived in hawaii since he was ousted three years ago in a popular uprising that propelled mrs aquino to power
i would like first of all to convey to the family of mr marcos that i do pray that he will still recover from this latest critical illness mrs aquino said
she said she has said in the past that we will not allow his remains to be brought back here and we have already taken plans to avoid any untoward incidents
mrs aquino whose government has survived six coup attempts has cited national security in refusing previous requests

we expect tactical alliances in this nationwide mass action said promarcos lawyer oliver lozano
but the chief of staff gen renato de villa said the armed forces would accept mrs aquinos decision and was prepared to block any attempts by the opposition to foment trouble
president corazon aquino of the philippines on monday asked government and industrial leaders to expand economic ties with her nation
mrs aquino on the first stop of her weeklong threenation european tour met with west german president richard von weizsaecker foreign minister hansdietrich genscher and other officials
mrs aquino comparing the task of strengthening the heavily indebted philippine economy to the recovery of west germany after world war ii asked that germany share its experience with her homeland
we have tried by sound fiscal policies not to buy recovery at the price of inflation nor debt relief at the price of national honor she said in a speech to the west german chamber of industry and trade
we have paid as careful attention to the consequences of runaway inflation and devaluation as germany in the light of her own experiences between the wars she said
mrs aquino said the philippines debt was projected to increase to  billion by years end but that much was money that was in fact stolen by the previous government of ousted dictator ferdinand marcos
she said that since her government took over in  the countrys growth rate of minus  percent under marcos in  had improved to a rate of plus  percent by 
what we need to complete the equation are two elements essential to the german recovery  debt relief and investments mrs aquino said
during a state banquet in the evening weizsaecker told mrs aquino her visit would further strengthen relations between west germany and the philippines
weizsaecker said the philippines have had good results in trade with west germany and assured mrs aquino that the barrierfree market the european economic community plans for  will not lock out trade with other countries
mrs aquino who arrived in west germany on sunday will meet with chancellor helmut kohl on tuesday before departing for paris
the resignation of the land reform secretary raises doubts about president corazon aquinos commitment to agrarian reform and dramatizes conflicts in a government criticized for lack of vision
the controversy climaxed thursday with the resignation of secretarydesignate florencio abad  whose nomination was opposed by the proaquino struggle of the democratic filipino party
handling of the controversy highlighted all the inconsistencies for which mrs aquino has been criticized lack of clear priorities tactical blundering and the strong influence of her relatives over national policy
it also reinforced the suspicion among liberals that for all her rhetoric mrs aquino does not share the deep commitment to social change which they expected when she took power in the  people power uprising against the late ferdinand marcos
the sincerity of corazon aquino is being seriously questioned wrote columnist ninez cachoolivares in the philippine daily inquirer
abads troubles began in february when he tried unsuccessfully to block the lease of government land in cavite province to japans marubeni corp for an industrial park
although the deal was approved by the national development corp abad a former congressman said the land should be distributed to peasants under the agrarian reform program
the department of trade and industry said the marubeni deal was crucial to attracting muchneeded foreign investment for the governments industrialization program
but the department of agrarian reform said if the cavite land was exempted hundreds of landlords would try to have their property declared as a potential industrial site to avoid losing title
the presidential staff finally worked out a compromise under which farmers would be offered either land or a cash settlement
abads firm stand however alarmed landowners in congress who floated rumors in the press that the agrarian reform department was riddled with communists
lawmakers on the commission on appointments who belong to the proaquino struggle of the democratic filipino party blocked abads confirmation through eight hearings until he finally resigned
the manila press transformed abad into a folk hero depicting him as the champion of the farmer against political barons of the struggle of the democratic filipino party dubbed landlorddominated party
worry not about abads destiny mrs president wrote columnist carol arguillas in the manila chronicle
abads strongest opponents included politicians who consistently support mrs aquino leading to speculation she was not disappointed when he departed
abads opponents included her younger brother rep jose peping cojuangco who wields considerable influence in government
there is no way cory aquino will challenge peping said one western diplomat speaking on condition of anonymity
the abad controversy was the latest in a series of blows to the agrarian reform program once touted as the centerpiece of the administration
last year agrarian reform secretary philip juico resigned after disclosures that his department paid vastly inflated sums for marginal land
his successor miriam defensor santiago was repeatedly rejected by the commission on appointments only to be reappointed until mrs aquino replaced her with abad on dec 
but mrs santiago claims she did not display sufficient public loyalty to mrs aquino during a coup attempt in early december
agrarian reform was widely seen as a means for breaking the power of landlord families and uplifting the livelihood of millions of peasants
the final bill contained so many prolandlord loopholes that several of its original sponsors including abad voted against it
president corazon aquino today reversed a longheld policy and said she was willing to negotiate ceasefires with communist guerrillas and former soldiers who have staged coup attempts
mrs aquino also invited the opposition to join the talks including her most outspoken critic sen juan ponce enrile
although no one has claimed responsibility for the blasts the government has blamed them on former soldiers who have repeatedly tried to toppled mrs aquino in coup attempts
sen wigberto tanada called for a truce between the government and the communist rebels after a major earthquake in the philippines on july  but mrs aquino rejected the proposal
on tuesday a proaquino senator orlando mercado urged mrs aquino to put aside differences with her political foes and begin to discuss the nations security problems and economic woes
enrile said he was willing to reconcile with mrs aquino who fired him as defense minister after he was implicated in a coup attempt in november 
mrs aquino said in a statement today that mercado and enrile are welcome to join discussions now being held by a committee of cabinet members
defense secretary fidel ramos has adamantly refused any ceasefire with the communist guerrillas since november  when the aquino government negotiated with the rebels during a day truce
ramos a member of the cabinet committee has been credited with crushing six coup attempts against mrs aquino
communists have accused him of whipping up threats of another coup attempt against mrs aquino so that the civilian leadership would become indebted to him
the last ceasefire with the rebels collapsed in january  after troops fired on farmers demonstrating outside mrs aquinos office for land reform
president corazon aquino said friday that for security reasons she would not permit deposed president ferdinand e marcos to be buried in the philippines
his frail body attached to a respirator and a hemodialysis bloodcleansing machine marcos is unconscious most of the time but occasionally shows faint signs of life doctors in hawaii said
philippine officials were asked repeatedly whether the aquino governments refusal to allow marcos to return to the country would remain in effect after his death
one radio station broadcast an interview with marcos wife imelda at the st francis medical center in honolulu where she was said to be maintaining a vigil at his bedside
i regret to inform mrs marcos that as much as i agree that mr marcos has his rights i still have to consider also the rights and the interests of millions of filipinos aquino told reporters at the presidential palace
in the past that we will not allow his remains to be brought back here and we have already taken plans to avoid any untoward incident
nonetheless marcos supporters announced that they will march through the capital today to support the former presidents demand that he be allowed to die in the philippines
despite charges that marcos and his inner circle looted the government treasury of billions of dollars the former president still has a significant following here
attempted coups government officials have accused marcos supporters of taking part in at least two attempted coups against the aquino government
aquino evidently is concerned that even after death the return of marcos remains could spark violence or galvanize opposition to her government
aquinos national security adviser rafael ileto told reporters friday that the philippine army is prepared for any emergency that might be provoked by the death of the former president
marcos mother josefa died a year ago but because marcos has been barred from this country the family refuses to have her remains interred
a newspaper advertisement published on the first anniversary of her death may  said funeral arrangements will be announced
marcos and his wife have been indicted by a federal grand jury in the united states on charges of racketeering fraud and extortion
the quick collapse of a bizarre military revolt on the philippines secondlargest island leaves president corazon aquinos beleaguered government with a muddied victory at best and clear danger signs ahead
analysts here say aquinos immediate use of small bombers and artillery to end a pocket rebellion led by renegade army col alexander noble on the north coast of mindanao helps counter oftheard criticism that her fouryearold government is indecisive and inept
and despite widespread fears that the oct  uprising would quickly spread to military garrisons on other islands and become a major threat to aquino leaders of the rightist military underground failed to move
moreover questions linger as to how noble and about  rebel troops so easily evaded a muchpublicized military manhunt to drive  miles from their mountain sanctuary pass unhindered through at least  military checkpoints and seize two military camps including the command post of the general who had been ordered to capture him  all without firing a shot
noble once chief of staff of aquinos own security detail quickly linked up with reuben canoy a local politician who heads the socalled mindanao independence movement
the resourcerich island has spawned secession groups since the th century  though canoys is the first to print fake passports and currency based on crude counterfeits of us  bills
noble best known for his long goatee and red stocking cap quickly surrendered with most of his motley army of soldiers and higaonon tribal militiamen after two world war iivintage t planes called tora toras here bombed and strafed one of the camps
aquino has now survived two major coup attempts and half a dozen assorted and aborted military mutinies
most ended in embarrassing standoffs or dragged on for days as top military leaders hedged on ordering troops to fire on other soldiers
this time was a different government response altogether which noble clearly had underestimated said university of the philippines political scientist alex magno
after the revolt the government toughened its anticoup law boosting the maximum penalty from  years to life in prison
aquinos spokesman tomas gomez iii urged other rebel leaders to take the honorable way out  suicide
ironically noble made his move on the day a presidential factfinding board issued a longawaited page report on the causes of last decembers coup attempt in manila which left more than  people dead
after  witnesses  sworn statements and  documents the socalled davide commission concluded that coup attempts are likely to continue  but unlikely to succeed  for the indefinite future
commission member delfin lazaro estimated that  officers involved in last decembers coup attempt which came closest to toppling aquino are still at large and still plotting
as a military coup attempt unfolded in their homeland  miles away supporters of the rebellious soldiers engaged in a shouting match thursday night with supporters of president corazon aquino at the philippine consulate in los angeles
about  members of the filipinoamerican movement for a better philippines held a candlelight vigil outside the consulate on wilshire boulevard to express sympathy with the coup led by officers linked to renegade lt col gregorio honasan
we are calling for mrs aquino to step down immediately said milo castelo  a los angeles attorney
castelo and a handful of the protesters then entered the office building and took the elevator to the thfloor consulate where a coalition of four filipino groups in los angeles that support the aquino government had just completed a press conference
half a dozen television news crews watched as the antigovernment protesters confronted the acting consul general for the philippines in los angeles willy c gaa
greg santillas of the campaign for democracy and independence said he believes that most of the estimated  filipinos living in los angeles county oppose the military coup
also present at the press conference was andrea aquino  the niece of assassinated marcos opponent benigno aquino cory aquinos husband
philippine vice president and opposition leader salvador h laurel declined saturday night to condemn the armed insurrection in his country and said the rebels have the right to try to seize power
he predicted that the fighting may turn to civil war if reported rebel reinforcements arrive from cebu mindanao and other islands
laurel who is known as doy broke with aquino shortly after they took office in  following a popular uprising that toppled former president ferdinand e marcos
he flew to hong kong but was stranded here with scores of journalists because the philippines two international airports in manila and cebu have been closed since the fighting began
laurel said  nacionalista leaders were meeting at the intercontinental hotel in manila late saturday despite the presence of rebel holdouts in the hotel
laurel criticized aquino for asking the united states to help bolster her beleaguered forces friday
us officials have said f phantom jets flew over rebel aircraft to keep them grounded but did not drop bombs or fire
but laurel said the us fighterbombers destroyed a philippine air force fuel dump and other facilities at sangley point and fired rockets that killed civilians near camp aguinaldo the armed forces headquarters
laurel added that aquino now is completely beholden to the united states just as exploratory talks on renegotiating leases for clark air base and subic bay naval base the two largest us military facilities abroad are beginning
laurels companion homobono adaza a former member of parliament under marcos and a nacionalista member also defended the rebels
laurel said the coup occurred because aquino failed to unite the nation or the armed forces leading to divided loyalties and fragmentation
he said she also failed to enforce the law against graft and corruption and had failed to deliver critical services
hurricane hugo struck south carolina with renewed fury thursday after thousands of coastal residents in southeastern states grabbed what they could carry and fled inland on jammed highways
this is a disaster staring us right in the eye mayor joseph p riley jr said from his city hall command post in charleston where the hurricane downed power lines snapped trees and caused utility transformers to explode
all we can do now is pray and hope all the precautions we have taken have been sufficient riley said as hugos eye bore in on the city
the roof cracked at city hall a yearold brick building that has withstood several hurricanes and torrents of water poured into the paneled council chamber
hurricaneforce winds first hit the coast by  pm edt and about three hours later the eye of the storm passed over the isle of palms just east of charleston said bob sheets director of the national hurricane center in coral gables fla
hugo was expected to turn gradually to the north causing severe flooding as it moved up the east coast
the storm posed a  percent chance of hitting new york city and a  percent chance of hitting boston before sunday night the hurricane center said
as hugo neared the coast roads from hilton head to myrtle beach  miles north were nearly empty as were the boardedup resort towns themselves
one eyewitness said its like a light show said amy garrison a reporter at wkzq amfm in myrtle beach
hospitals stockpiled supplies discharging any patients well enough to go and moving others to hospitals inland to make room for emergency patients officials said
about  people had checked into  shelters across the state as of thursday evening and more were expected said bennish brown a spokesman for the emergency operations center in columbia  miles northwest of here
we tried to close the doors but people are sneaking in side doors said elaine skelton a registered nurse working at the conway high school shelter near myrtle beach
american red cross relief efforts were buckling under the number of evacuees said brian ruberry a spokesman in savannah ga who appealed for help
at midnight the center of hugo was near latitude  degrees north and longitude  degrees west forecasters said
near its center hugos muscle reached winds of  mph up from  mph earlier in the day and  mph the day before
north and south carolina can expect tornadoes linked to hugo for the next two days according to the hurricane center
the coastal area could expect hurricane force winds for  to  hours once the eye comes ashore officials said
a hurricane warning was in effect between fernandina beach fla and oregon inlet nc by late afternoon hugo was upgraded to a category  hurricane on the saffirsimpson scale of strength the second mightiest category which indicated it could cause extreme damage
it strengthened more than we thought it would sheets said adding that hugo would cause severe flooding as it moved up the appalachians
the timing of the landfall was critical because of the storms tidal surge a dome of water  to  feet high that would feed a normal foot high tide that peaks after  am on top of that will be waves sheets said earlier and in many places on barrier islands the buildings will be swept clean off
this historic city has survived the ravages of earthquake battle and storm in its storied yearhistory but it faced perhaps its greatest test of all in hurricane hugo
this is a dangerous killer hurricane the likes of which few people who have lived all their lives in charleston have experienced warned mayor joseph p riley jr hugo was the first major hurricane to strike charleston since hurricane gracie came ashore  miles to the south in 
the worst in recent decades was in  when a tornado tore through the city killing  people injuring hundreds and causing an estimated  million in property damage
charleston a city of pastelcolored antebellum structures lining quaint streets and alleyways is where the civil war began in 
the city has survived the shot and shell of two wars and any number of smaller hurricanes politely referred to by charlestonians of refinement as september gales
but the worst natural disaster to beset the city occurred on the hot night of aug   when the ground rumbled in what some folks thought was a prelude to judgement day
measuring  on the richter scale of ground motion the earthquake claimed an estimated  lives destroyed  buildings and tossed most of the citys  chimneys into the streets
in recent years the city has attracted millions of visitors annually who tour its historic buildings and visit its nearby fine sand beaches
charleston has received international acclaim as home to spoleto festival usa founded by composer gian carlo menotti
while hurricane hugos  mph wind roared outside mayor joseph p riley jr watched the fury it vented on his beloved yearold city
riley city officials and a few reporters stayed in charlestons historic city hall through thursday night as the areas worst hurricane in three decades pounded the coastal city where the civil war began
but the storm gathered strength and speed as it spun straight toward this city which had survived a number of near misses from great storms in recent years
from the moment it became apparent hugo might strike the southeast coast many charlestonians conceded that this time their number was up
as hugos wind howled outside the plywood boards protecting the windows reporters wandered in and out of rileys office
later there was a sharp crack as a piece of the tin roof ripped off and water seeped down on the burnished wood tables in the city council chamber
as the eye of the storm passed he took reporters onto the porch of the yearold brick city hall to look at the damage
the initial view sketched out in the glow of flashlights was unsettling the tin roof was tossed in the gutter slate tiles were scattered on the ground
as the storm died before dawn riley was out on the streets again in a raincoat carrying a flashlight to get a better assessment of the damage
supercomputers satellites and the expertise of several hurricane forecasters predicted the destructive path hurricane hugo would follow giving people plenty of time to flee the south carolina coast
forecasters at the national hurricane center used computer models to track hugos path into charleston sc all the worlds knowledge about meteorological conditions and forecasting changes in those conditions is embodied in those models said thomas pyke head of national oceanic and atmospheric administrations satellite service
pinpointing the exact point of hugos landfall was difficult but forecasters said friday that the landfall was predicted in time for evacuation
overall i think the tracking models gave us a very good idea where hugo would be so officials in south carolina could act in a timely manner said research meteorologist colin mcadie
the real forecasting problem with hugo was predicting the intensity of the storm which was upgraded to a category  hurricane just hours before it slammed into charleston
the hurricane specialists were surprised by the lastminute increase in wind speed which was reported to them by air force reconnaissance
hurricane specialist gil clark who has tracked hurricanes for  years said that a couple of decades ago the only forecasting tools were reports from aircraft or ships
information from the satellite is used to improve the accuracy of the largescale models that television viewers see every night
using the information from the satellite supercomputers at the national meteorological center in suitland md send information to the hurricane center where a tracking model constantly changes to account for current weather conditions and the position of the hurricane
to determine the track of the storm the forecasters analyze supercomputer predictions satellite data the history of similar storms and the current path of the hurricane
meteorology professor kerry a emmanuel of the massachussetts institute of technology criticizes the current forecasting system
congress and the american people are suffering from the collective delusion that our data problems have been solved by satellites and that just isnt true emmanuel said
satellites can give a pretty picture he said but not enough information about the wind and temperatures that affect a hurricanes path
most of the information actually used to predict hurricanes comes from flying airplanes into the hurricane and they do a very good job emmanuel said
forecasters say the accuracy of satellite pictures is improving every year so longrange forecasting should become more precise
we have to remember that those models used are only guidance products pyke said and that its ultimately the job of the forecaster to predict the storms path
residents took forecasters at their word when they warned of hurricane hugos fury and the low number of deaths from the powerful storm can be credited to this healthy respect authorities said
the storm which caused billions in damage claimed  lives in south carolina and only two were in the charleston area which bore the brunt of hugos  mph winds
we just feel very thankful about that said mayor joseph p riley jr several thousands of people who were in the shelters and the tens of thousands of people who evacuated inland were potential victims of injury and death
riley and other officials credited residents with monitoring the hurricane as it spun toward charleston and heeding evacuation warnings
the last big storm to hit south carolina was hurricane david in  which hit the coast after pounding southern florida
since then several big storms have threatened but veered away and officials were worried that charlestonians wouldnt heed hugos warnings
weve had so many close calls said gary garnet a meteorologist with the national weather service
glen ellis a red cross official estimated that  residents in charleston and the three surrounding counties headed for shelters
mayor john bourne of north charleston where there apparently were no stormrelated deaths credited people for heeding the warnings
meanwhile garnet had some good news for stormweary charlestonians late saturday the tropics were quiet with no other storms brewing
its taken the devastation caused by hurricane hugo to stimulate repayment of a yearold debt between two cities almost  miles apart
as a way of repaying a kindness dating to  kingston is raising money to help charleston sc recover
the letter included nearly  new york pounds to help kingston residents get through their crisis
this money has been received for the charitable purpose of alleviating the distresses of the nowindigent inhabitants of the town of kingston who by the ravages of the enemy are reduced to poverty and want livingston wrote on march  
kingston historian edwin ford remembered the letter when hurricane hugo ravaged the carolinas last week
a lot of people have been calling asking to send donations down there said susan lawlor executive director of the ulster county chapter of the red cross
on tuesday new york state sent two airplanes full of food clothing and water to parts of the caribbean ravaged by hugo
a new york national guard ca cargo plane also left tuesday to pick up equipment in mississippi and take it to puerto rico
another cargo plane was scheduled to leave stewart air force base in newburgh taking  tons of food water and other supplies to puerto rico
hurricane hugo advanced faster and with renewed fury today on georgia and south carolina as  coastal residents grabbed what they could carry and fled inland on jammed highways
were not going to take any chances said lamar davis a bartender on st simons island off southern georgia who stole a last glance at the pounding surf before leaving with his wife and yearold daughter
a hurricane warning was in effect between fernandina beach fla and oregon inlet nc at  pm hugo was  miles from savannah and bearing down at  mph
tidal surge feared the timing of the landfall was critical because of the storms tidal surge a dome of water  to  feet high that would feed a normal foot tide that peaks after  am on top of that will be waves and so on 
barrier islands in many places the buildings will be swept clean off of those islands bob sheets director of the national hurricane center said from coral gables fla evacuees queued up at gasoline stations and stripped store shelves of bottled water bread and batteries
officials warned coastal dwellers not to linger because gale force winds and flash floods could block escape routes
carroll campbell dispatched  national guardsmen to assist a mandatory evacuation of coastal barrier islands and shorefront
resort streets deserted by early afternoon the windswept streets of the resort island of hilton head were deserted
we brought our photo albums and our important papers said pat bross who had stopped for gas while heading from hilton head to augusta ga with her husband
the georgia emergency management agency opened shelters and advised about  people  more than  of them in chatham county  to leave their homes
the states biggest shelters were opened at georgia southern college in statesboro with room for  and the veterans administration medical center in dublin where officials said nearly  could be housed
hugo was upgraded to a category  hurricane on the saffirsimpson scale of strength indicating that it was powerful enough to cause extensive damage
the two dominant home and automobile insurers in the carolinas said tuesday that they expect to be hit with about  million in claims from hurricane hugo
state farm insurance co expects claims as high as  million in south carolina where it insures one out of every five homes spokesman jerry parsons said
the bloomington illbased company is also projecting an additional  million in claims from storm damage in north carolina and virginia he said
additionally nationwide insurance co said it expects claims close to  million more than triple the  million that the company paid for damages caused by hurricane elena when it swept through florida alabama and mississippi in 
our previous alltime high was in  when we paid  million in comparable claims for hurricane alicia which struck galveston and houston
officials said property damage from hugo escalated because the storm scored a direct hit on charleston and then instead of heading out to sea veered northwest hitting other population centers including charlotte nc losses still being tallied nationwide based in columbus ohio is the biggest home and auto insurance in north carolina where damage was unexpectedly high and is the thirdlargest insurer in south carolina
although claims adjusters are still tallying the losses there is now little doubt that overall damage to insured property will far exceed the record  million in claims paid by the industry after hurricane frederic struck mississippi and alabama in  parsons said
the insurance information institute is expected to issue a report thursday on overall insured losses from hugo
although the losses are substantial they are not expected to threaten the financial health of any individual company because reinsurers will pick up a significant portion of the costs
for example nationwide said it would be responsible for up to  million in claims while its reinsurers would cover up to  million in damages
reinsurers  which share a portion of the risk on an insurance policy in exchange for part of the premium income  typically spread their risk over many hundreds of companies
analysts said most of the claims will be borne by mutual insurance companies which are owned by policyholders but they noted that losses from hurricane hugo would also affect the shortterm earnings of some publicly traded companies
continental corp said it expects to report a pretax charge of  million for the third quarter reflecting its net exposure to damages from the storm
the new yorkbased company had substantial business in puerto rico and the virgin islands where hugo first struck with devastating force
forecasts may be cut the charge might push continental into the red for the quarter said udayan ghose an analyst with shearson lehman hutton in new york
ghose said shearson may also cut its thirdquarter and annual earnings projections for cigna corp usfg corp and lincoln national corp which are expected to suffer hurricanerelated losses equal to about  of expected fullyear earnings
overall  catastrophic losses for the industry now total about  billion and analysts expect hugo to make this year the costliest
but this could be a positive for the industry ghose said explaining that the industry is in the middle of a price war because it is overcapitalized
billions of dollars in losses from hugo and other catastrophes this year would have a significant impact on excess capital he said causing insurance firms to raise prices shortly
hurricane hugo will go down in the record books as the costliest storm insurers have faced so far but it wont cause propertycasualty premium rates to rise immediately analysts and company officials say
the property claims service division of the american insurance service group a trade association is expected to announce its estimate of total insured losses tomorrow
hugo will be the biggest hurricane loss on record said one official far surpassing the  million insurers paid out after frederick ripped through several gulf coast states in 
the impact on premium rates could be minimal for now analysts expect because the biggest losses will be in the personal insurance area  for homes and autos
most companies typically set aside funds from premiums they collect every year to cover claims they might have to pay in the future
in the last three years hurricane and storm seasons have been relatively mild so insurers havent had to dip into these funds
yet some analysts believe hugos huge losses will make a dent in the industrys capital and crimp cash flow that could make insurers less likely to slash premium rates further in coming months
udayan ghose at shearson lehman hutton inc believes these reasons might cause rates to edge higher by mid
for the time being the losses from hugo will be substantial but they wont be something the industry cant handle said charles l ruoff director of strategic planning at fred s james  co a new yorkbased insurance broker
for instance state farm mutual automobile insurance co estimates it will pay claims totaling more than  million to homeowners and for some small businesses
nationwide insurance co a mutual company based in columbus ohio said hugo is the single largest claims disaster it has seen in its year history
new yorkbased continental corp which is a big insurer in puerto rico the virgin islands and south carolinas said it will take a  million pretax charge against earnings this quarter reflecting its net exposure to the damages caused by the hurricane
philadelphiabased cigna corp which has extensive domestic foreign and reinsurance operations in the areas hugo hit and usfg corp in baltimore a big insurer in the carolina region could also be forced to take onetime charges against thirdquarter earnings analysts said
both usfg and cigna declined to predict whether they would take a charge usfg said it would be responsible for the first  million of losses and its reinsurance would cover the bulk of additional losses
hugo could have a marginal impact on thirdquarter income at travelers corp aetna life  casualty insurance co and chubb corp according to industry analysts
mr ruoff at fred s james believes that even if losses from hugo total as much as  billion insurers wont feel enough financial pain such as not being able to pay shareholder dividends to compel them to boost premium rates right away
he explained that in the first six months of this year net income for the industry declined slightly from  but insurance companies were still earning an adequate rate of return on equity
he also noted that the industrys aggregate net worth or policyholders surplus currently at  billion is also plentiful
insurers also buy protection for themselves through reinsurance by paying another company a portion of the premium to bear some of the losses
michael lewis at dean witter reynolds said losses from hugo could be big enough to temporarily increase reinsurance rates
although reinsurance will limit the exposure of some companies the losses they must still cover could hurt thirdquarter results
niagara exchange corp based in buffalo ny said monday it will report a loss from operations for the third quarter and possibly for the year because of the substantial losses that its charleston insurance co unit faces as a result of the hurricane
damage from hurricane hugo which stormed through the carolinas and the caribbean last week will reduce thirdquarter earnings for several insurers
new yorkbased american international group inc expects net losses related to hugo to reduce pretax earnings between  million and  million
analysts said aig has told them that it must cover the first  million of losses and that its reinsurance agreements will cover the bulk of the remaining damages
aig insured property in puerto rico the eastern caribbean islands and the coastal regions of the carolinas
st paul cos based in st paul minn said the pretax cost of hugo shouldnt exceed  million
that amount takes into consideration what st paul expects to recover under its reinsurance contracts the company said
philadelphiabased cigna corp is expected to disclose hugos likely impact on its earnings sometime today
udayan ghose an insurance industry analyst at shearson lehman hutton in new york estimates that cignas thirdquarter pershare earnings could be reduced by between  cents and  cents a share on an aftertax basis
state farm mutual automobile insurance co said its state fire  casualty co unit estimates claim payments from hugo will exceed  million in south carolina alone far surpassing the companys record payout for a single disaster
it said that is more than three times the previous record of  million set by hurricane alicia which hit the houstongalveston texas area in

the magazine is just one of hundreds of businesses whose officials and customers will be among the  fans attending the super bowl
and the companies show few signs of cutting back on their activities despite the new tax laws tighter restrictions on what can be claimed as a businessentertainment expense
still the new rules do change things for a variety of super bowl entertaining  from an executive sitting in a  seat on the yard line to a businessman holding a super bowl party in his living room and hoping to write off the costs
one big change under the new law limits businessentertainment deductions for tickets to sporting events like the super bowl only  of the face value of such tickets can be deducted
even to get the  deduction there still must be a substantial and bona fide business discussion before during or after the game says julian block a tax specialist at prenticehall information services inc to take a client to a game as merely a goodwill gesture is no longer enough mr block says
and if a company wants to simply give clients tickets to the game the business gift carries a total deduction of only  for each recipient

executives who bring clients over to the house to watch the super bowl on television also face new restrictions on deductions for food and liquor says william j lipton tax partner of the accounting firm ernst  whinney
if a host wants to deduct  of the bill he or she must talk business with all of the guests mr lipton says

allen hermansen a hilton senior vice president says the bash is tax deductible because our sales people will be there and business will be discussed
but irs enforcement of the rules could be as difficult as blocking the new york giants lawrence taylor
as a practical matter as long as people say they talked business at a super bowl party how can the irs dispute it

tokyo ap  emperor hirohito will be remembered for one overwhelming decision during his year reign japan must bow to defeat for the first time in its history and end the pacific conflict in world war ii
shortly after that decision and for most of his reign hirohito became a figurehead isolated from his subjects by tradition and steeped in his great love the study of marine biology
the solitude of animal and plant life under the seas which so intrigued hirohito was in keeping with the character of the man who became the th occupant of the chrysanthemum throne at the age of  on christmas day  designating his reign showa  enlightened peace
the emperor was generally portrayed as having played no significant role in planning or carrying out japans military adventures in the s and s
on aug   four days after historys first atomic bomb devastated hiroshima and one day after a us bomber dropped the second atomic bomb on nagasaki the generals and admirals of imperial japans wartime government argued for hours in the sweltering bombproof shelter beneath the tokyo palace

three weeks later hirohito donned a silk cutaway coat striped trousers and a top hat to meet the allied commander gen douglas a macarthur at the us embassy in tokyo
it was the first time hirohito had ever gone to see anyone and the first of several calls on the general who had led the pacific war against japan and became its postwar governor
it was a choice that enabled hirohito to remain as the symbolic head of his nation and assured that he would not face charges as a war criminal as some abroad had demanded
it also was an act that seemed to relieve no one as much as this gentle shy and retiring man who never seemed very comfortable as a living god
he possessed rare collections of marine life discovered several species himself and wrote or coauthored at least  books on hydrozoa or sea animals his specialty
a nationwide survey by the daily newspaper mainichi shimbun in march  indicated more than  percent of  people polled supported the imperial system while only  percent said it should be abolished
the imperial household agency which ran his affairs said hirohito considered the postwar period one of the most fulfilling times of his life in which the nation made a phenomenal recovery from a war that cost  million japanese lives
despite the humanization of the imperial family hirohito remained under strict control of the imperial household agency
in accordance with ageold imperial custom he was taken from his parents as an infant to be reared in isolation by household functionaries and trained for one role that of emperor
the feudal samurai ethic was still strong when his grandfather died gen maresuke nogi the mentor for the yearold prince calmly committed ritual suicide to follow the emperor his master to the grave

us prosecutors pressured japans wartime prime minister gen hideki tojo into changing testimony at his trial to avoid incriminating emperor hirohito in war crimes a television documentary claims
the british broadcasting corp documentary details of which were released wednesday by its maker edward behr said the us prosecutors worked with the emperors aides to find a way to avoid putting hirohito on trial
the documentary challenges hirohitos image as a peaceful man forced to go along with his generals plans and alleges among other things that he must have known about the massacre of at least  chinese at nanking in  because he received regular detailed reports from the china front
knew more than a month in advance of japanese plans to attack the us navy at pearl harbor on dec  
it has been reported previously that american prosecutors wanted to keep hirohito out of the war crimes trial and asked tojo to suggest the emperor had consented reluctantly to the war on the advice of the high command
gen douglas macarthur commander of the us forces occupying japan wrote in his book reminiscences that he fended off pressure from britain and the soviet union to indict hirohito arguing that would touch off a guerrilla war
behr told the associated press in a telephone interview wednesday that the documentary will be shown in the united states by pbs on march 
the bbc has also sold it to australia austria canada hong kong israel korea the netherlands norway spain and sweden
the documentary says the decision not to prosecute hirohito came from president harry s truman and that tojos evidence was altered so the emperor would not be incriminated
the foreign habit of using his name rankled some japanese who found it impolite and unnecessary since to them there is only one emperor
some japanese complained that after his death it even became inaccurate to call him hirohito because he has been given the posthumous name showa
in japanese histories he will be recorded as emperor showa the name he chose for his reign soon after he became emperor in 
it means enlightened peace and has been succeeded by heisei or achieving peace the name the government chose for the reign of hirohitos son akihito a few hours after the emperor died jan 
but for the convenience of the rest of the world which is not so able to keep track of the person behind the changed name even official agencies have used the name hirohito in englishlanguage publications
the obituary issued in english by the foreign press center which is supported by the foreign ministry was headed his late majesty the emperor hirohito
englishlanguage newspapers published in japan quickly began using the name showa for hirohito after his death but it did not become truly official until jan  when emperor akihito conducted a ceremony in which showa became the late emperors posthumous name
the custom of renaming emperors after the completion of their reigns began after the death in  of emperor meiji hirohitos grandfather
thus  became showa  as crown prince hirohito ascended to the throne on dec  when his father emperor taisho died
the japanese custom of changing imperial names is not unique among world royalty where an individual may have a variety of names and titles in a royal career
emperor hirohito left  million in taxable property a tax office near the imperial palace announced monday
it was the first time that tax authorities have disclosed the amount of an emperors taxable estate an official in the kojimachi tax office said
akihito has paid  million in inheritance taxes on his half of his fathers estate which he divided evenly with his mother
the empress dowager as hirohitos spouse was exempt from paying inheritance taxes kyodo news service reported
the japanese constitution drafted by us occupation forces shortly after the end of world war ii in  stipulates the emperor is the symbol of the state and the unity of the people
three sacred treasures  a mirror sword and jewels  which were transferred from emperor to emperor were taxexempt as were about  items of art owned by hirohito that were donated to the state the tax office official said
the death of emperor hirohito finished the list of political and military leaders of the world war ii era one of the darkest and bloodiest eras of history on either the european or asian continents
at the surrender of the imperial japanese government hirohito was spared punishment because it was his ambitious military generals who made the decision to invade the neighbors
i found it is very hard to believe that a man in his middle age in his position in his culture and in his country at that time had nothing much to do with all the military aggravations that his armies imposed on neighboring countries
i often wonder if hirohito ever felt grateful to those generals who were sacrificed in part so that he could live for another  years
i only wish that the soul of emperor hirohito be ready to face the ultimate justice when he meets with the waiting souls of millions of innocent men women and children who were tortured and murdered in his name during the war

tomorrow evening just before the olympic closing ceremony the last and one of the most prestigious events of the games will be held
run in high heat high humidity high pollution levels and over an extraordinary course the barcelona olympic mens marathon will prove one of the most physically demanding ever run
it is estimated that when the race begins in mataro a seaside town north of barcelona the temperature will be an alreadyuncomfortable c
towards the marathons end however radiant heat thrown off by buildings could be subjecting the runners to a temperature of up to c
the last km which take the runners m higher still to the olympic stadium at the top of the hill of montjuic has an average gradient of more than  per cent and includes some sections of  per cent equivalent in skiing terms to a steep red run
last saturday in the olympic stadium i watched the final moments and aftermath of the womens marathon begun at the same time of day and run in similar conditions
never in any event voluntarily entered into sporting or otherwise have i seen such signs of physical and mental distress
the race was won by the unified teams valentina yegorova in  hours  minutes a time considerably slower than that achieved by women on less demanding olympic marathon courses in los angeles and seoul
after her nearest competitor japans yuko arimori came in eight seconds later they had the energy  between bouts of grimacing and lowering their heads to their knees  to embrace each other and smile for the cameras

as a photographer calmly shot off a roll of film a foot from her face manuela machado of mexico and another runner stood vomiting violently into a potted palm
several competitors lay prone and gasping on the ground as water was poured over them others stood hunched over grasping their abdomens
male marathon runners will face the same kind of problems with heat humidity and an overdemanding terrain he said
in his opinion gearing the marathon to primetime tv viewing and having the event end at the top of a hill for the sake of stadium spectators was unjustified and a sellout to commercialism
to put on the marathon in the late afternoon rather than first thing in the morning the normal practice and then to make them run km up a hill is just criminal in my opinion said brasher a former olympic gold medal athlete and noted sportswriter
i spoke to britains steve brace winner of the paris marathon in  and  the berlin marathon last year and a competitor in the barcelona event
he agrees that the run will be highly demanding and while he regards olympic marathon running as a pinnacle of his career he is cautious about tomorrows slog
as an incomeearner marathon running is an activity with liabilities and limitations and requires business management as well as physical ability
the winner of the london marathon earns a tidy dollars  and the new york boston and japanese runs are all in the same prizewinning category
with their careers and financial prospects in mind toplevel runners normally only run two marathons a year
brace says that in spite of the prestige and possible financial spinoffs involved it does not necessarily make sense to run to win
given the highly demanding nature of the course and their desire to preserve physical condition for races that do bring in money he says many runners will give less than their best effort
try to think of sundays los angeles marathon less as a happening which it surely is or a worldclass athletic event which it may become but is not now
look at it more as a moving advertising opportunity human billboards running  miles through the city on live television
with that kind of exposure to a potential  million southern californians its no wonder that in only five years the l a marathon has become the bestmarketed slickest most modern and sponsordriven of the worlds major marathons
massive marketing campaigns and major sponsors lining up for a seat on the money wagon do not make l a an elite race give it prestige or attract the worlds best runners
and that may yet transform this race if  as marathon president bill burke said this week  the total purse of  is increased by  next year and significantly more money is added for appearance fees to lure top athletes
the race has mercedesbenz of north america as its presenting sponsor making it one of  companies that have not only paid the race organizers to be called sponsors but have also put more money into the race either outright or by providing products and services
according to will kern director of times special events this years marathon has received almost  worth of donated advertising space
in addition the marathon sells its name to licensees and suppliers who donate everything from fruit and water to the official salted snack and the official hairgrowth product
according to mary reiling national event manager for att the la marathons sponsorfriendly approach is a big incentive
ive worked a lot of events with a lot of different promoters but they are by far the most creative group ive ever seen she said
mercedesbenz which also sponsors marathons in new york and san francisco likes the fact that the race gives them a foothold in their no
the whole marketing approach of bill burke is great for sponsors said linda paulmeno manager of press relations for mercedesbenz
the marathon receives several hundred thousand dollars from kcop channel  for the television rights and the race has also been sold to cable and will be covered by radio

by the time most people were starting their first cup of coffee sunday morning benjamin paredez martinez of ecatepec mexico and kathy smith of newport beach were crowned winners in the san diego marathon at the oceanside pier efforts than earned them  apiece
the runs set records on the new north county course but the times even helped by warm breezes and clear degree conditions were hardly blistering
martinez  finished in  hours  minutes  seconds  seconds faster than doug kurtis of northville mich smiths  seemed days quicker than the  posted by escondidos mindy ireland
runners often from mexico would register late and race officials were at their wits end when the media screamed to know the identity of the leader
they knew who martinez was but no one was sure how he was able to practically appear out of nowhere to take the lead from alfredo rosas of san pedro going into the mile mark
rosas and a pack of as many as eight came out at a pace seven to  seconds quicker per mile
after the mile mark the pack has already thinned to just rosas danny bustos doug kurtis and ernesto gutierrez who ran single file for a time
martinez and martin rodriguez rivera held back but martinez soon heard a little voice that told him to move or be removed from contention
since martinez hadnt been seen earlier it originally was thought the figure gainly ground slowly but methodically from mile  to mile  was san diegos henry chio
martinez late kick caught rosas who had broken away on his own for a threemile lead at mile  cramped and been surprised at the mile mark
before martinez took the lead for good  a uphill surge at mile   it appeared rosas was hearing footsteps and was looking over his shoulder to see who was gaining on him
the only recurring theme in martinez and smiths backgrounds  other than the  miles they ran  was that they are novices at longdistance running this was their first victory at this distance and that they are both teachers
martinez is a worldclass biathlete who finished third at the world duathlon championship two weeks ago near palm springs
she was holding class with reporters long before ireland  was carried into a room for mandatory drug testing  the united states olympic committee drug testing program randomly selected this race to administer tests to the top finishers
my goal was to come out here be as lowkey as possible and try to qualify for the trials said smith who finished fourth last year and ran a personalbest time sunday
smith said she and ireland ran together  they even chatted  through the mile mark until smith got her feet working faster than her mouth
having run with ireland last year in the san diego marathon smith knew a little of irelands racing style
smith earlier this year ran the long beach marathon where she finished seventh but has been concentrating on this distance for just a year
but weak field or not the plus runners who participated in the event seemed to relish the experience as all the problems the marathon has had to deal with faded as each runner crossed the finish line
its a beautiful course and this was a great marathon one runner told race director lynn flanagan

 for example all  checkpoint records were shattered through the first  miles last year either by simon robert naali or juma ikangaa both of tanzania
 the winner was  olympic champion gelindo bordin who outsmarted the early pacesetters by running a patient calculating race
 running alone about  meters behind a pack of six africans bordin passed them all by  miles and went on to win in  hours  minutes  seconds the secondfastest time in the races history behind only the  by rob de castella in  ikangaa finished a distant second in 
they include ibrahim hussein of kenya the  winner in  the thirdfastest time in boston and one second ahead of ikangaa abebe mekonnen of ethiopia the  champion in  bostons eighthbest time douglas wakiihuri of kenya the  world champion and  olympic silver medalist who is making his boston debut and naali the thirdplace finisher in the  commonwealth games
 among those chasing them will be john treacy the  olympic silver medalist and the thirdplace finisher in boston in  and  geoff smith the boston winner in  ed eyestone the topranked us marathoner salvador garcia the runnerup to wakiihuri in last years new york city marathon and rolando vera who finished third in his marathon debut in boston in  the womens division also is filled with many respectable entrants
 foremost among them are kristiansen the yearold norwegian who holds the world record of  and won in boston in  and  and samuelson  the usrecord holder at   olympic gold medalist and boston champion in  and  challenging them will be uta pippig wanda panfil and kim jones

starting at dawn six hours before the official noon start mr foley would eventually saunter across the finish line in the moonlight
of course mr kelley  not to be confused with the other john kelley who won the boston marathon in   isnt the runner he was in  when he won the race in  hours  minutes  seconds
when john kelley first toed the line in  george bush wasnt yet in kindergarten joe dimaggio was an unknown and nike was the winged goddess of victory not a running shoe
in those days mr kelley recalls he ran in black leather highjumping shoes that he cut open at the toes with a razor blade
today of course the boston marathon is a big deal covered by tv from start to finish and offering  altogether in prize money
physiologically whatever that means i got all as mr kelley reports of his checkup four months ago
what that means explains kenneth cooper the physician who wrote aerobics and several sequels and is now at work on a book on elderly athletes is that johnny has the body of a man  years younger
mr kelleys resting pulse rate   beats a minute  is well below the average persons  beats
on the stress test the clinic gives mr kelley holds the endurance record for his age group
a mechanic for boston edison co before he retired in  mr kelley started running in the evenings after work more than six decades ago
mr kelley well knows the jagged course from hopkinton to downtown boston the first challenge comes five miles into the race where a set of little hills can get a psyched runner to waste energy charging up the slopes
a mile and a half later theres new reason to beware the smells of cavanaughs bakery can set off hunger pangs
though still going strong mr kelley acknowledges the marathon gets tougher each year
in recent years ive been in training  months a year he says though the serious stuff  a daily onehour run sprints on the track and long  hour runs every other week  begins in december
he doesnt count the miles he puts in as many longdistance runners obsessively do but he says he wouldnt object to an estimate of about  miles a week
mr kelley always trains at  am and alone its a quiet time no traffic the air is fresh and sweet
with the approach of spring he takes to the alder and scrubpine hills and bluffs where the sun can be seen rising over cape cod bay
after his morning run he spends a couple of hours painting still lifes and cape cod scenes a hobby he took up about  years ago
unlike many runners mr kelley doesnt bother with stretching exercises before he runs in the morning
he and his wife laura live in a twobedroom ranchstyle house here in east dennis with more than  trophies medals and sweatstained marathon numbers scattered about
he isnt particular about brands of shoes i wear them all or what he eats i never eat broccoli but i love steak and ice cream
two weeks after a failed launch attempt an improved discovery is ready to embark on one of the most momentous shuttle missions hoisting the hubble space telescope high enough to behold the threshold of time
if the launch goes on schedule and all else goes well the first picture from hubble could be available next weekend
you can cut it with a knife incredible said eric chaisson senior scientist at the space telescope science institute at johns hopkins university in baltimore
nothing at least scientifically seems to have been lost as a result of the twoweek wait one of numerous delays plaguing the mission since its original  launch date
the  billion telescope the most expensive unmanned spacecraft ever built rests safely inside discoverys payload bay awaiting the tuesday launch
if all goes well discovery will return to edwards air force base calif on sunday april  with an empty payload bay
nasa said it may release its first telescope image from hubble  of an open star cluster in the constellation carina  as early as that same day
after the early test images are made and other preparatory work is done hubble is expected to start providing significant scientific data by satellite in a month or two
the telescope is named for the late astronomer edwin p hubble who discovered during the s the universe constantly is expanding
his work gave rise to the theory the universe was created by a tremendous explosion about  billion years ago
from its perch far above earths obstructing atmosphere the telescope will be able to discern objects  times fainter and with  times greater clarity than the best groundbased observatory
by studying stars and galaxies so distant their light has been traveling to earth for  billion years they hope to determine the precise origin of the universe and learn whether other solar systems  and life forms  exist
nasas sole attempt to launch discovery was halted four minutes before liftoff april  when one of the shuttles three auxiliary power units failed
the pound unit was replaced with a new one the first time nasa ever had installed such a unit at the launch pad
the procedure went so smoothly the space agency decided last week to advance the launch to tuesday a day earlier than planned
the batteries will power hubble from the time it is disconnected from discoverys power system until its energycollecting solar panels are deployed  miles above earth the highest a shuttle has ever gone
astronaut steven a hawley will use the shuttles mechanical arm to lift the pound telescope into space on the second day of the mission
mission specialists bruce mccandless ii and kathryn sullivan veteran spacewalkers will leave the cabin to assist if necessary
the shuttle will follow hubble from  miles away in case a problem develops and the telescope must be retrieved and returned to earth
you can never eliminate those oddball quirks of fate or gremlins that may sneak up on any given day sullivan said
in addition to the  billion cost of the telescope  million has been spent to stockpile spare parts train astronauts and develop computer software to operate the instrument
the european space agency contributed  million to the hubble project and will get to use the telescope  percent of the time
five astronauts boarded discovery today for a second try at sending the hubble space telescope into orbit to scan the outermost reaches of the universe for clues to the beginning of time
astronomers are starting to tingle again in anticipation of what the hubble will be able to accomplish said lennard fisk head of nasa science activities
air force forecasters said there was a  percent chance the weather would be favorable for launching the shuttle at the scheduled time of  am edt
more than a half million gallons of liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen were pumped into the space ships fuel tanks after midnight
the astronauts wearing bright orange flight suits climbed into the crew cabin just as dawn was breaking over the kennedy space center
the  billion telescope nasas costliest cargo will give astronomers a new set of eyes and ears that we dont have said william lenoir head of nasas space flight program
i cant say what were going to learn but ill be astounded if we dont learn many new things
discovery was aiming for an altitude of  miles the highest a shuttle has ever gone so the telescope can be placed in its proper orbit far above earths distorting atmosphere
columbia which journeys into space next month with the astro observatory sat on a launch pad  miles from discovery only the second time both pads have been occupied the first was in  just before the challenger explosion
hubble has been waiting to take its place in space since  delayed by technical problems and the challenger accident
the latest postponement occurred april  when discoverys launch was scrubbed four minutes before liftoff because of a faulty power unit on the shuttle
the mood at the kennedy space center was considerably less festive than during the first launch attempt when hundreds of astronomers gathered with their families
the day after launch mission specialist steven a hawley will use the shuttles mechanical arm to lift the pound telescope into space
discovery will follow hubble from  miles away for two days until after its lens cap is opened exposing the finely polished inch mirror to starlight
however nasa said it will release its first image  an open star cluster in the constellation carina  a week after launch
in addition to the  billion cost of hubble  million has been spent on spare parts astronaut training and computer software to operate the instrument
during its year working lifetime the telescope will provide astronomers with  times better resolution and  times more sensitivity than groundbased observatories
as a result they will be able to study stars and galaxies so distant their light has been traveling toward earth for  billion years
astronomers hope to learn whether the universe was created  billion years ago as believed and uncover some of the mystery surrounding galaxies black holes and quasars
in addition to hubble discovery carries a human skull filled with sensors to measure the space radiation that astronauts receive
jubilant astronomers saw decades of work take wing tuesday as the hubble space telescope was boosted high above earth to launch a great adventure for mankind
charles robert odell a rice university space physicist who has worked  years on hubble said seeing it hurled into orbit aboard the shuttle capped an experience that was comparable to raising a child
colin norman a physics and astronomy professor at johns hopkins university and academic affairs director of the space telescope science institute there called the launch the perfect start to a great adventure for mankind
the  billion telescope originally was scheduled for launch in  but remained grounded by technical problems and the challenger explosion
two weeks ago when hundreds of scientists crowded into the kennedy space center the launch was scrubbed four minutes before liftoff
there were times when we were elated about hubbles progress said william h jeffreys a university of texas astronomer and hubbles astrometry project leader
ed weiler nasa program scientist for hubble said watching the liftoff was a double whammy because it was my first shuttle launch and the launch of the hst
seven years late the hubble space telescope is where it belongs out of this world and in search of others so distant that they may have been formed at the beginning of time
less than five hours after it rode into space aboard the shuttle discovery on tuesday the  billion telescope sent its first test radio signal
discovery trailing an arc of white smoke into a brilliant blue sky carried the silvercolored telescope to an orbit  miles above earth  higher by  miles than any previous shuttle
there the hubble will stay to search for yetunseen wonders of creation with instruments that can look  billion years backward in time
nasa launch commentator george diller exulted as the discovery rose off its seaside launch pad
its a beautiful day to have hubble space telescope in orbit instead of here on earth like its been for so many years said nasa administrator richard truly
it suffered a further delay two weeks ago when the countdown was stopped at the fourminutestogo point because of a faulty hydraulic unit on the shuttle
in its first day in space that checkout and testing continued remotely under control of the goddard space flight center in maryland
on hand to watch the discovery launching was a contingent of scientists who have hailed the hubble as the greatest advance in astronomy since galileo raised a small telescope to his eyes nearly  years ago
truly referred to the earlyday astronomer when he was asked about the long delays in getting the telescope to its working station
when it flies free it will receive electrical power for its six scientific instruments from two winglike solar arrays that extend outward on each side
it is named after the late astronomer edwin p hubble who theorized that the universe was expanding and that the farther away a galaxy is the faster it is traveling
that gave support to the theory that a massive explosion  the big bang  created the universe  to  billion years ago
in addition the fine pointing system acts as a sixth instrument by providing precise measurement of distances
on wednesday hawley is to grapple the ton telescope with the shuttles mechanical arm lift it out of the cargo bay point it and  after a long checkout  drop it overboard to orbit on its own
but the juice is cut when the instrument is lifted out and it will depend on internal batteries until the solar panels are extended to receive light from the sun
should the solar panels not deploy mission specialists bruce mccandless and kathryn sullivan will be standing by partially dressed in space suits ready to go into the open cargo bay to unfurl the arrays manually
with  seconds left in the countdown the computer that runs the final moments before liftoff refused to close a fuel valve and stopped the launch process
on the way uphill as commander loren j shriver put it the shuttles windshield was splattered with several flecks of things
he said the windshield was streaked by the debris and that it also was smeared when the spent booster rockets fell off during the climb to orbit
the astronauts also had problems with their uhf radio circuit and one of the ships small rear thrusters was inoperative
already theyre saying its the biggest happening in astronomy since galileo put his eye to a telescope
ride along to the beginning of everything almost to the big bang of  or  thousand million years ago
peer deep into the universe past so many stars in our own galaxy that it would take a person more than a lifetime to count to a hundred billion other galaxies each with about  billion stars
for scientists and then the rest of us all that becomes possible now that the space shuttle discovery has carried the hubble space telescope into the sky to see what no one has seen before
the telescope a silvery tube as long as a tanker truck has an unmatched ability to detect and capture the faintest light
tracking the trail of light from today to the first moments contains all the information we will ever have about the creation of the universe
in the history of optical astronomy there have been two great leaps in the resolution of the universe galileos telescope in the autumn of  and the hubble space telescope in april 
dr lennard fisk nasas chief scientist predicts that the hubble telescope will literally be the dawn of a new era in astronomy
hubble was an astronomer in the first half of the century who concluded not only that distant galaxies are moving away from earth but that the farther away they are the faster they move
the theory of an expanding universe supported the belief that the universe originated in a cosmic explosion and that all matter is still rushing from the site of that socalled big bang
astronomers think the big bang occurred  billion to  billion years ago and sent the entire universe flying out at incredible speed and heat
there are bigger telescopes than the hubble but they are all on earth and all subject to a major limitation  the atmosphere  which is fine for breathing but lousy for seeing through
the voyager spacecraft which sent back astonishing views of earths sister planets had to travel  years to get close enough for pictures as they whizzed past
on a clear dark night you can see a flashlight from two miles away says weiler chief nasa scientist on the hubble project
discoverys astronauts overcame balky equipment to send the hubble space telescope floating free from the shuttle today on a year quest for secrets of the universe
the  billion telescope began orbiting earth every  minutes at an altitude of  miles  high above the atmosphere which has limited the view of groundbased telecopes
the final hours before its release were a nightmare for ground controllers as they commanded the unfurling of two solar panels that power the telescopes instruments
we have confirmation that the solar array wing on the starboard side has been deployed the telescope control center in maryland said
the deployment of the two foot panels allowed sun power to flow into the telescopes batteries relieving worries that they would use up their eighthour charge
before astronaut steve hawley was able to lift the ton telescope from the cargo bay with the shuttles mechanical arm its instruments had to be disconnected from the shuttles power and shifted over to the batteries
precisely one day after lifting off from launch pad b at kennedy space center the hubble space telescope is ready to fly on its own mission controls jeffrey carr said
astronauts kathryn sullivan and bruce mccandless put on spacesuits and entered an airlock in order to be ready to walk outside and pull out the array had mechanical deployment of the solar panels failed
cameras aboard discovery showed the telescope being held at the end of a foot crane reflecting sunlight from its silver surface and a turning earth in the background
earlier this morning discovery commander loren j shriver maneuvered the shuttle into its deployment position with its nose pointed toward the sun
that was to put the telescopes solar arrays once unfurled at the proper angle to quickly start collecting energy and protect the telescopes fixed star trackers while the instrument was being held above the payload bay
for those technically inclined this morning id like to pass on the quote of the day from the onboard astronomer hawley something to the effect that the big marble sure looks far away today shriver said
the five astronauts busy day began on a musical note early this morning as mission control played a song called space is our world written by members of discoverys training team and a houstonarea group private numbers
controllers monitoring the telescope at goddard space flight center in maryland said tuesday that no problems had been detected so far aboard hubble the most expensive and complex unmanned spacecraft ever built
everything has just being going like clockwork said ron schlagheck shift director of orbital verifications at goddard
the hubble telescope delayed by technical problems and the  challenger accident has waited seven years to take its place in space
hubble will allow astronomers to study stars and galaxies so distant their light has taken  billion years to reach earth
it is expected to provide clues to the age and size of the universe and it may solve the mysteries of quasars pulsars and black holes and even find stars with planets that could conceivably support life
when it is in orbit it will receive electrical power for its six scientific instruments from two winglike solar arrays
it is named for the late astronomer edwin p hubble whose discovery during the s that the universe is expanding gave rise to the big bang theory that the universe was created by a tremendous explosion  billion to  billion years ago
after years of delay and a lastminute snag the hubble space telescope was freed from the shuttle discovery on wednesday and glinting in the sunlight drifted into orbit on its year search for new worlds
mission specialist steven hawley released hubble from the end of the shuttles footlong mechanical arm after a delay in getting one of the telescopes solar wings unfurled
the first of nasas great observatories is now on station at  nautical miles above the earth mission controls jeffrey carr said
the telescope really looked great as we flew away from it and we sure hope it does good work discovery commander loren j shriver said later
the  billion telescope was released at  pm edt as the shuttle entered its th orbit of earth nearly two hours and one orbit later than planned
thank you very much for the ride said mike harrington director of orbital verifications at goddard space flight center in greenbelt md
mission specialists bruce mccandless and kathryn sullivan had been in the shuttles airlock ready to walk inspace to free the solar panel
the first solar array unreeled from its mast at midday wednesday as the shuttle passed  statute miles or  nautical miles above south americas eastern coast
hawley began the long process of releasing hubble shortly after  am edt when he grasped it with discoverys footlong mechanical arm and carefully hoisted the ton telescope high above the shuttle
hubble was taken off shuttle electrical power just before it was lifted out of the cargo bay and was operating on its own nickelhydrogen batteries
at one day seven minutes into the flight of discovery hubble is now on its own internal power carr said
worries that the telescopes instruments would be starved for electricity eased after the first solar panel was stretched out
television cameras aboard discovery showed the first array as it was pulled from its reel slowly but steadily the sun reflecting off the goldcolored panel and silvery telescope
id like to pass on the quote of the day from the onboard astronomer something to the effect that the big marble sure looks far away today shriver said of hawley
the mission was delayed another two weeks when a faulty power unit on discovery forced the national aeronautics and space administration to halt the first launch attempt four minutes before april s scheduled liftoff
the telescopes foot aperture door is to be opened friday exposing the finely polished inch mirror to starlight
fred wojtalik hubble project manager said the telescope would be tested thursday for its ability to maneuever before the aperture door is opened
we want to be in full control so we dont ever endanger the hubble by putting the aperture door close to the sunlight he said
if all goes well the crew will land sunday at edwards air force base calif nasa expects to release its first image from the telescope  of an open star cluster in the constellation carina  on tuesday
astronomers hope to look back to almost the beginning of the time studying stars and galaxies so distant their light has been traveling to earth for  billion years
the telescope is named for the late american astronomer edwin p hubble who discovered during the s that the universe was expanding
ground controllers at the goddard space flight center finally made contact today with the two main antennas on the  billion hubble space telescope after trying for more than six hours to lock on
applause erupted in the hubble control center in greenbelt md as the glitch that marred hubbles first full day in space was solved
we have confirmation that we have achieved communication with the tracking and data relay satellite through the highgain antenna system said nasas dave drachlis
engineers had said all along they believed the antennas were working all right and that the problem was in incorrectly pointing either the satellite or the tdrs an orbiting communications satellite that acts as a switchboard
in the successful attempt they nearly doubled the width of the antennas beams to take in more territory from a sweep of  degrees to  degrees
the telescopes lowgain antennas which receive and transmit information at a much slower rate and can be used in emergencies were working well
the five astronauts were otherwise busy making pictures of storms over texas from their milehigh perch and doing experiments
steve terry director of a team calibrating various aspects of the telescope said the first outage was caused by human error and was not a serious problem
the second failure occurred at  am when controllers attempted to send a signal to the telescopes two highgain antennas through the tdrs
the telescope embarking on a year search for new worlds was released from the shuttles cargo bay wednesday after a lastminute snag that almost sent two astronauts on an emergency spacewalk
mission control awakened the crew early today with a loud rendition of the song shout a fraternity house favorite
after wednesdays deployment shriver gently backed discovery away from the telescope and put the shuttle through a series of maneuvers the last one completed this morning to park discovery in orbit  miles behind hubble
the telescope really looked great as we flew away from it and we sure hope it does good work shriver said wednesday
well it sure is now loren and thanks for all the great work youve done replied mission control
scientists have hailed the hubble  nasas most expensive unmanned spacecraft  as the greatest advance in astronomy since galileo raised a small telescope to his eyes nearly  years ago
discovery and its five astronauts will follow the telescope while controllers at the goddard center make sure hubble is operating properly such as responding to directional commands
the next milestone is friday when the telescopes foot aperture door is to be opened exposing the finely polished inch mirror to starlight
then on tuesday nasa expects to release the first image from the telescope an open star cluster in the constellation carina
if the aperture door doesnt open properly discovery could return to the telescope so two astronauts could perform a spacewalk to fix it
hubble project manager fred wojtalik said the telescope would be tested today for its ability to maneuver before the aperture door is opened
we want to be in full control so we dont ever endanger the hubble by putting the aperture door close to the sunlight he said
on wednesday mission specialist steve hawley used the shuttles foot robot arm to gently grasp the ton telescope and hoist it from the cargo bay
one of the telescopes solar arrays unreeled from its mast as expected and started providing power to the telescopes batteries which otherwise had only eight hours of charge
by the final attempt astronauts bruce mccandless and kathryn sullivan were in their space suits in the airlock  minutes away from taking tools in hand and going on an outerspace maintenance call
astronomers hope to use the telescope to look back to almost the beginning of the time studying stars and galaxies so distant their light has taken  billions years to reach earth
discovery which blasted into orbit tuesday is scheduled to land sunday at edwards air force base calif
ground controllers cheered after reestablishing contact thursday with the  billion hubble space telescope through its main antennas
im pretty relieved i must say said al boggess hubble project scientist at goddard space flight center in greenbelt md
applause erupted at goddards space telescope operations control center when the highspeed contact was made thursday afternoon
controllers sent information to the telescope about its location and this basically improved the telescopes knowledge where it was what its position was said goddards dave drachlis
they also widened the radio beam to cover a larger area around the two highspeed dish antennas
we have confirmation that we have achieved communication with the tracking and data relay satellite through the highgain antenna system drachlis reported
the problem began thursday morning when engineers tried pointing the two highspeed antennas toward two widelyseparated tdrs satellites without success
two lowspeed antennas were working fine but boggess said they would be excruciatingly slow for sending data
in addition one of four rate gyros wheels whose spin maintains the telescope in a stable position was disconnected by an automatic system for a reason engineers were unable to explain immediately
the problems wont delay the schedule for putting the telescope into use said jean oliver hubble deputy project manager at marshall space flight center in huntsville ala now we have to do an analysis to make sure ourselves just what part of it worked and whether there are things we have to do differently in the future to make it continue to work boggess said
space shuttle discovery trailed  miles behind the telescope and was to stay nearby until the hubbles aperture door was opened set for friday morning
its five astronauts spent the day doing experiments and taking pictures of storms over texas and other views of earth from  miles up the highest a shuttle has ever flown
when the door covering the telescope aperture is opened starlight will strike the telescopes finely polished inch mirror for the first time
if signals fail to activate the footwide aluminum aperture door mission specialists bruce mccandless and kathryn sullivan will go into open space and crank it open saturday
on tuesday the national aeronautics and space administration releases its first image from the telescope an open star cluster in the constellation carina
the ton footlong telescope about the size of a bus is named for astronomer edwin p hubble who died in 
the missouriborn hubble discovered during the s that the universe is expanding a finding that gave rise to the theory the universe was created about  billion years ago by a tremendous explosion
the lens cover on the hubble space telescope opened today after a morning of worrisome problems and mission control told the discovery astronauts they no longer are needed to rescue the  billion instrument
youve been released from hubble support its on its own mission control told the astronauts when the aluminum aperture door opened
thank you sir thats great news said discovery commander loren j shriver
there are handshakes and smiles all around up here said steve hawley who had been at the controls when the telescope was released into its own orbit on wednesday
when the door opened two of its four positionstabilizing gyroscopes stopped working and the electronic system went into an automatic safe mode in which all motion is stopped
the team at the goddard space flight center in maryland which guides the telescope said the dooropening motion jarred the telescope more than had been expected and that the system reacted properly in shutting down
steve terry a top hubble engineering official said tolerances for the telescope systems had been set particularly narrow for the first operations and that was the cause of many malfunctions
the space shuttle discovery which carried the telescope to orbit was  miles behind the telescope ready to lend a hand if needed
the lens cover a foot diameter aperature door covers the opening to the telescopes light shield
the lens cover had been closed  except for a tiny wedge opening  ever since the  billion telescope was dropped overboard by the discovery crew on wednesday
now that it is opened starlight can strike the lens for the first time and it can go about its business of photographing and analyzing the universe in ways and with sensitivity never before possible
if the door opening command had failed the five discovery astronauts who deployed hubble were prepared to head back to the telescope
mission specialists bruce mccandless and kathryn sullivan would have performed a space walk to open the door saturday if necessary
if it had been needed the rescue would have delayed the landing scheduled for sunday at edwards air force base calif by a day
for max qs keyboard thats the way that song should really be done mission control radioed to mission specialist steve hawley a member of the allastronaut band called max q
max q is a nasa acronym for the point in the shuttles ascent when the aerodynamic pressure is at its greatest point
in an orbit high enough to avoid earths distorting atmosphere hubble will allow astronomers to study stars and galaxies so distant their light has taken  billion years to reach earth
it is capable of detecting objects  times fainter and with  times greater clarity than the best groundbased observatory
it may solve the mysteries of quasars pulsars and black holes and even find stars with planets that could conceivably support life
on tuesday nasa plans to release its first test image from the telescope an open star cluster in the constellation carina
the ton footlong telescope about the size of a bus is named for astronomer edwin p hubble who died in 
the missouriborn hubble discovered during the s that the universe is expanding a finding that gave rise to the theory the universe was created about  billion years ago by a tremendous explosion
the hubble space telescope orbited with its big eye open friday after ground controllers overcame communications problems and lifted its lens cover but its electronics were shut down due to a malfunction
those problems however were not the immediate concern of shuttle discoverys astronauts who prepared for sundays return to earth
landing would have been delayed a day if astronauts bruce mccandless and kathryn sullivan had had to perform a space walk to crank open the telescopes lens cover or aperture door
the shuttle trailed  miles behind hubble when the aperture door opened  miles above earth but passed  miles beneath the telescope later in the day
the national aeronautics and space administration had planned to release its first test image from the  billion telescope on tuesday showing an open star cluster in the constellation carina
but steve terry director of orbital verifications said that would be delayed by problems with hubbles highspeed antennas
hubbles foot aluminum aperture door was opened to the heavens at  am edt nearly four hours later than planned exposing its finely polished inch mirror to starlight for the first time
ground controllers sent a signal commanding the door to lift even though the telescope was in an automatic safe mode with all motion stopped because of problems in linking its highspeed dish antennas with a relay satellite
one of the two antennas apparently had swung too far and the telescope shut down said jean oliver a hubble deputy project manager
if future movements of the antenna have to be limited to avoid the problem it would have only slight impact on the telescopes observing time oliver said
when the door opened two of hubbles four positionstabilizing gyroscopes stopped working later engineers got them back on line
the motion of the lens cover knocked out the gyros said dave drachlis of the goddard space flight center in maryland
it will take another day to get the instrument operating normally again putting controllers at goddard several days behind
were trying to be very deliberate and trying not to cut any corners and do anything fast because we feel theres a lot at risk here and we want to make sure were doing it properly oliver said
weve got a long future ahead of us and we want to make sure it starts off on the right foot
tolerances for the telescope systems were set particularly narrow for the first operations and that was the cause of many malfunctions terry said
terry said hubble is designed with safe modes so it can be the master of its own destiny in case contact with an orbiting communications system is lost for extended periods
except for a tiny wedge opening the lens cover had been closed and the telescope blind ever since hubble was released by the astronauts wednesday
from its orbit high above earths distorting atmosphere the telescope will enable astronomers over its year working lifetime to look back  billion years and possibly determine the age of the universe
the late astronomer edwin p hubble for whom the telescope is named provided the basis for the big bang theory of creation
in honor of the astronomer sullivan carried with her into space an eyepiece from the inch telescope at californias mount wilson observatory that hubble used to make his pioneering observations
its a great pleasure to have something of such historical significance and something that so directly symbolizes edwin hubbles fundamental contributions to astronomy she said friday afternoon
the hubble space telescope was awakened from its selfinduced sleep today but it was still without the use of its highspeed antennas and its science instruments were on hold unable to begin any observations
discoverys astronauts meanwhile packed their gear for a return to earth sunday made some lastminute observations of earth and talked with groundbased reporters about their flight
pilot charles bolden said he was especially upbeat about the widespread public awareness of the telescope which is expected eventually to look back  billion light years  nearly to the birth of the universe
its hard to go somewhere and find someone who has never heard of the hubble space telescope said bolden
the telescopes big eye has remained open but hubble had been in a safe mode with all motion stopped because of earlier problems in linking the highspeed dish antennas with a relay satellite
terry said that even in the safe mode one of the tape recorders in the telescope reads telemetry signals from all its systems and that these would be played to earth and analyzed when the antennas are working properly
engineers are able to send commands to the telescope via its secondary antennas but the communications system is not useful for scientific data which must be transmitted at a high rate of speed
shortly after  am edt controllers at the goddard space flight center in greenbelt md completed a series of commands that took the telescope out of its safe mode and then began to run a hour computer program to monitor hubbles health
it will take another day before the  billion telescope is operating the way it was supposed to at this point in the startup process said hubble deputy project manager jean olivier
the telescope problems have put the flight center several days behind but the five astronauts who deployed it earlier this week were sticking to their schedule
landing is scheduled for  am edt sunday at edwards air force base calif but flight controllers were keeping a close watch on the weather
the shuttle carries enough supplies to stay in orbit three days beyond sunday if necessary nasa said
the song was selected in honor of hubble space telescope which is now open for business said mission control commentator james hartsfield
shriver and pilot charles bolden were to run through a series of tests to make certain the shuttles computers and control jets were ready for return to earth
the crew deployed hubble on wednesday but they had stayed close to the telescope in case there was trouble opening the aperture door
mission specialists bruce mccandless and kathryn sullivan were prepared to perform a space walk today to crank it open in orbit  miles above earth
but that proved unnecessary when the door was opened friday morning exposing the telescopes finely polished inch eye to starlight for the first time
two of hubbles four positionstabilizing gyroscopes stopped working when the door opened but engineers later got them back on line
the gyroscopes were knocked out by the motion and that too kept the telescope in the safe mode said dave drachlis director of orbital verifications at goddard
a colleague steve terry said hubbles systems were set at conservative limits for the first operations and that caused many malfunctions
hubble is designed with safe modes so it can be the master of its own destiny in case contact with an orbiting communications system is lost for extended periods terry said
nasa had planned to release its first test image from the telescope on tuesday showing an open star cluster in the constellation carina
the telescope named for the late astronomer edwin p hubble will enable astronomers over its year working lifetime to look back  billion years and possibly determine the age of the universe
discoverys five astronauts returned sunday for a second attempt to launch the shuttle with nasas most valuable and celebrated payload the  billion hubble space telescope
we feel very confident that things are going to go well this time said discoverys commander air force col loren j shriver
nasa test director mike leinbach said sunday that the countdown was proceeding smoothly and the shuttle appeared to be in perfect condition
a faulty power unit forced the first launch attempt to be scrubbed four minutes before liftoff april 
a  percent chance of favorable weather was expected at launch time with low clouds being the main concern said the air forces ed priselac shuttle weather officer
as discoverys astronauts arrived from johnson space center in houston early sunday afternoon the shuttle columbia was being transported to a launch pad  miles from discovery
columbia commander vance brand said he does not believe the national aeronautics and space administration is moving too fast with his shuttle
nasa expects to launch columbia with an astronomical observatory called astro no earlier than may  one week later than planned because of discoverys twoweek delay
the six nickelhydrogen batteries will power hubble from the time it is disconnected from discoverys electrical system until its two energycollecting solar panels take over in space
discoverys payload bay was sealed late saturday night drastically reducing the risk of contamination to the telescopes finely polished inch mirror
discovery will aim for an altitude of  miles the highest a shuttle has ever gone so the telescope can be placed in its proper orbit far above earths distorting atmosphere
during hubbles year journey through space astronomers expect to look back to nearly the beginning of time and solve some of the universes most perplexing mysteries
astro will measure ultraviolet radiation undetected by hubble and thus provide additional targets for the telescope
the  million observatory also will focus during columbias nineday mission on comet austin believed to be on its first trip through the solar system
five astronauts boarded discovery today for a second try at sending the hubble space telescope into orbit to scan the outermost reaches of the universe for clues to the beginning of time
astronomers are starting to tingle again in anticipation of what the hubble will be able to accomplish said lennard fisk head of nasa science activities
air force forecasters said there was a  percent chance the weather would be favorable for launching the shuttle at the scheduled time of  am edt
more than a half million gallons of liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen were pumped into the space ships fuel tanks after midnight
the astronauts wearing bright orange flight suits climbed into the crew cabin just as dawn was breaking over the kennedy space center
the  billion telescope nasas costliest cargo will give astronomers a new set of eyes and ears that we dont have said william lenoir head of nasas space flight program
i cant say what were going to learn but ill be astounded if we dont learn many new things
discovery was aiming for an altitude of  miles the highest a shuttle has ever gone so the telescope can be placed in its proper orbit far above earths distorting atmosphere
columbia which journeys into space next month with the astro observatory sat on a launch pad  miles from discovery only the second time both pads have been occupied the first was in  just before the challenger explosion
hubble has been waiting to take its place in space since  delayed by technical problems and the challenger accident
the latest postponement occurred april  when discoverys launch was scrubbed four minutes before liftoff because of a faulty power unit on the shuttle
the mood at the kennedy space center was considerably less festive than during the first launch attempt when hundreds of astronomers gathered with their families
the day after launch mission specialist steven a hawley will use the shuttles mechanical arm to lift the pound telescope into space
discovery will follow hubble from  miles away for two days until after its lens cap is opened exposing the finely polished inch mirror to starlight
however nasa said it will release its first image  an open star cluster in the constellation carina  a week after launch
in addition to the  billion cost of hubble  million has been spent on spare parts astronaut training and computer software to operate the instrument
during its year working lifetime the telescope will provide astronomers with  times better resolution and  times more sensitivity than groundbased observatories
as a result they will be able to study stars and galaxies so distant their light has been traveling toward earth for  billion years
astronomers hope to learn whether the universe was created  billion years ago as believed and uncover some of the mystery surrounding galaxies black holes and quasars
in addition to hubble discovery carries a human skull filled with sensors to measure the space radiation that astronauts receive
seven years late the hubble space telescope is where it belongs out of this world and in search of others so distant that they may have been formed at the beginning of time
less than five hours after it rode into space aboard the shuttle discovery on tuesday the  billion telescope sent its first test radio signal
discovery trailing an arc of white smoke into a brilliant blue sky carried the silvercolored telescope to an orbit  miles above earth  higher by  miles than any previous shuttle
there the hubble will stay to search for yetunseen wonders of creation with instruments that can look  billion years backward in time
nasa launch commentator george diller exulted as the discovery rose off its seaside launch pad
its a beautiful day to have hubble space telescope in orbit instead of here on earth like its been for so many years said nasa administrator richard truly
it suffered a further delay two weeks ago when the countdown was stopped at the fourminutestogo point because of a faulty hydraulic unit on the shuttle
in its first day in space that checkout and testing continued remotely under control of the goddard space flight center in maryland
on hand to watch the discovery launching was a contingent of scientists who have hailed the hubble as the greatest advance in astronomy since galileo raised a small telescope to his eyes nearly  years ago
truly referred to the earlyday astronomer when he was asked about the long delays in getting the telescope to its working station
when it flies free it will receive electrical power for its six scientific instruments from two winglike solar arrays that extend outward on each side
it is named after the late astronomer edwin p hubble who theorized that the universe was expanding and that the farther away a galaxy is the faster it is traveling
that gave support to the theory that a massive explosion  the big bang  created the universe  to  billion years ago
in addition the fine pointing system acts as a sixth instrument by providing precise measurement of distances
on wednesday hawley is to grapple the ton telescope with the shuttles mechanical arm lift it out of the cargo bay point it and  after a long checkout  drop it overboard to orbit on its own
but the juice is cut when the instrument is lifted out and it will depend on internal batteries until the solar panels are extended to receive light from the sun
should the solar panels not deploy mission specialists bruce mccandless and kathryn sullivan will be standing by partially dressed in space suits ready to go into the open cargo bay to unfurl the arrays manually
with  seconds left in the countdown the computer that runs the final moments before liftoff refused to close a fuel valve and stopped the launch process
on the way uphill as commander loren j shriver put it the shuttles windshield was splattered with several flecks of things
he said the windshield was streaked by the debris and that it also was smeared when the spent booster rockets fell off during the climb to orbit
the astronauts also had problems with their uhf radio circuit and one of the ships small rear thrusters was inoperative
after years of delay and a lastminute snag the hubble space telescope was freed from the shuttle discovery on wednesday and glinting in the sunlight drifted into orbit on its year search for new worlds
mission specialist steven hawley released hubble from the end of the shuttles footlong mechanical arm after a delay in getting one of the telescopes solar wings unfurled
the first of nasas great observatories is now on station at  nautical miles above the earth mission controls jeffrey carr said
the telescope really looked great as we flew away from it and we sure hope it does good work discovery commander loren j shriver said later
the  billion telescope was released at  pm edt as the shuttle entered its th orbit of earth nearly two hours and one orbit later than planned
thank you very much for the ride said mike harrington director of orbital verifications at goddard space flight center in greenbelt md
mission specialists bruce mccandless and kathryn sullivan had been in the shuttles airlock ready to walk inspace to free the solar panel
the first solar array unreeled from its mast at midday wednesday as the shuttle passed  statute miles or  nautical miles above south americas eastern coast
hawley began the long process of releasing hubble shortly after  am edt when he grasped it with discoverys footlong mechanical arm and carefully hoisted the ton telescope high above the shuttle
hubble was taken off shuttle electrical power just before it was lifted out of the cargo bay and was operating on its own nickelhydrogen batteries
at one day seven minutes into the flight of discovery hubble is now on its own internal power carr said
worries that the telescopes instruments would be starved for electricity eased after the first solar panel was stretched out
television cameras aboard discovery showed the first array as it was pulled from its reel slowly but steadily the sun reflecting off the goldcolored panel and silvery telescope
id like to pass on the quote of the day from the onboard astronomer something to the effect that the big marble sure looks far away today shriver said of hawley
the mission was delayed another two weeks when a faulty power unit on discovery forced the national aeronautics and space administration to halt the first launch attempt four minutes before april s scheduled liftoff
the telescopes foot aperture door is to be opened friday exposing the finely polished inch mirror to starlight
fred wojtalik hubble project manager said the telescope would be tested thursday for its ability to maneuever before the aperture door is opened
we want to be in full control so we dont ever endanger the hubble by putting the aperture door close to the sunlight he said
if all goes well the crew will land sunday at edwards air force base calif nasa expects to release its first image from the telescope  of an open star cluster in the constellation carina  on tuesday
astronomers hope to look back to almost the beginning of the time studying stars and galaxies so distant their light has been traveling to earth for  billion years
the telescope is named for the late american astronomer edwin p hubble who discovered during the s that the universe was expanding
ground controllers at the goddard space flight center finally made contact today with the two main antennas on the  billion hubble space telescope after trying for more than six hours to lock on
applause erupted in the hubble control center in greenbelt md as the glitch that marred hubbles first full day in space was solved
we have confirmation that we have achieved communication with the tracking and data relay satellite through the highgain antenna system said nasas dave drachlis
engineers had said all along they believed the antennas were working all right and that the problem was in incorrectly pointing either the satellite or the tdrs an orbiting communications satellite that acts as a switchboard
in the successful attempt they nearly doubled the width of the antennas beams to take in more territory from a sweep of  degrees to  degrees
the telescopes lowgain antennas which receive and transmit information at a much slower rate and can be used in emergencies were working well
the five astronauts were otherwise busy making pictures of storms over texas from their milehigh perch and doing experiments
steve terry director of a team calibrating various aspects of the telescope said the first outage was caused by human error and was not a serious problem
the second failure occurred at  am when controllers attempted to send a signal to the telescopes two highgain antennas through the tdrs
the telescope embarking on a year search for new worlds was released from the shuttles cargo bay wednesday after a lastminute snag that almost sent two astronauts on an emergency spacewalk
mission control awakened the crew early today with a loud rendition of the song shout a fraternity house favorite
after wednesdays deployment shriver gently backed discovery away from the telescope and put the shuttle through a series of maneuvers the last one completed this morning to park discovery in orbit  miles behind hubble
the telescope really looked great as we flew away from it and we sure hope it does good work shriver said wednesday
well it sure is now loren and thanks for all the great work youve done replied mission control
scientists have hailed the hubble  nasas most expensive unmanned spacecraft  as the greatest advance in astronomy since galileo raised a small telescope to his eyes nearly  years ago
discovery and its five astronauts will follow the telescope while controllers at the goddard center make sure hubble is operating properly such as responding to directional commands
the next milestone is friday when the telescopes foot aperture door is to be opened exposing the finely polished inch mirror to starlight
then on tuesday nasa expects to release the first image from the telescope an open star cluster in the constellation carina
if the aperture door doesnt open properly discovery could return to the telescope so two astronauts could perform a spacewalk to fix it
hubble project manager fred wojtalik said the telescope would be tested today for its ability to maneuver before the aperture door is opened
we want to be in full control so we dont ever endanger the hubble by putting the aperture door close to the sunlight he said
on wednesday mission specialist steve hawley used the shuttles foot robot arm to gently grasp the ton telescope and hoist it from the cargo bay
one of the telescopes solar arrays unreeled from its mast as expected and started providing power to the telescopes batteries which otherwise had only eight hours of charge
by the final attempt astronauts bruce mccandless and kathryn sullivan were in their space suits in the airlock  minutes away from taking tools in hand and going on an outerspace maintenance call
astronomers hope to use the telescope to look back to almost the beginning of the time studying stars and galaxies so distant their light has taken  billions years to reach earth
discovery which blasted into orbit tuesday is scheduled to land sunday at edwards air force base calif
the shuttle that put the hubble space telescope into orbit also carries an instrument used in the s by astronomer edwin hubble the eyepiece from what once was the worlds most powerful telescope
its a great pleasure to have something of such historical significance and something that so directly symbolizes edwin hubbles fundamental contributions to astronomy astronaut kathy sullivan said friday as she circled the earth in space shuttle discovery
its basically a symbolic gesture from the past of astronomy to the future of astronomy said lyn mcafee spokeswoman for the mount wilson institute
the pasadenabased group runs the observatory located in the san gabriel mountains outside los angeles
the discoveries made by hubble on the inch telescope at mount wilson gave us a giant leap forward in our understanding of the universe mcafee said
the hooker telescope was the worlds most powerful telescope from its construction in  until  when the inch hale telescope was placed in operation at mount palomar observatory northeast of san diego
using the hooker telescope hubble was the first to determine the distance to a galaxy outside the milky way the institute said in a statement
this crucial discovery provided the first definite proof that other galaxies existed far beyond the confines of our own local galaxy the institute said
during the s and s hubble and an assistant used the hooker telescope to take thousands of photographs of faint galaxies showing that most of them were moving away from each other very quickly
this provided observational evidence for the concept suggested by einsteins theory of relativity that the universe is expanding the institute said
hubbles work helped convince scientists the universe was created in a giant explosion called the big bang an estimated  billion years ago
the hubble space telescope was awakened from its selfinduced sleep today but it was still without the use of its highspeed antennas and its science instruments were on hold unable to begin any observations
discoverys astronauts meanwhile packed their gear for a return to earth sunday made some lastminute observations of earth and talked with groundbased reporters about their flight
pilot charles bolden said he was especially upbeat about the widespread public awareness of the telescope which is expected eventually to look back  billion light years  nearly to the birth of the universe
its hard to go somewhere and find someone who has never heard of the hubble space telescope said bolden
the telescopes big eye has remained open but hubble had been in a safe mode with all motion stopped because of earlier problems in linking the highspeed dish antennas with a relay satellite
terry said that even in the safe mode one of the tape recorders in the telescope reads telemetry signals from all its systems and that these would be played to earth and analyzed when the antennas are working properly
engineers are able to send commands to the telescope via its secondary antennas but the communications system is not useful for scientific data which must be transmitted at a high rate of speed
shortly after  am edt controllers at the goddard space flight center in greenbelt md completed a series of commands that took the telescope out of its safe mode and then began to run a hour computer program to monitor hubbles health
it will take another day before the  billion telescope is operating the way it was supposed to at this point in the startup process said hubble deputy project manager jean olivier
the telescope problems have put the flight center several days behind but the five astronauts who deployed it earlier this week were sticking to their schedule
landing is scheduled for  am edt sunday at edwards air force base calif but flight controllers were keeping a close watch on the weather
the shuttle carries enough supplies to stay in orbit three days beyond sunday if necessary nasa said
the song was selected in honor of hubble space telescope which is now open for business said mission control commentator james hartsfield
shriver and pilot charles bolden were to run through a series of tests to make certain the shuttles computers and control jets were ready for return to earth
the crew deployed hubble on wednesday but they had stayed close to the telescope in case there was trouble opening the aperture door
mission specialists bruce mccandless and kathryn sullivan were prepared to perform a space walk today to crank it open in orbit  miles above earth
but that proved unnecessary when the door was opened friday morning exposing the telescopes finely polished inch eye to starlight for the first time
two of hubbles four positionstabilizing gyroscopes stopped working when the door opened but engineers later got them back on line
the gyroscopes were knocked out by the motion and that too kept the telescope in the safe mode said dave drachlis director of orbital verifications at goddard
a colleague steve terry said hubbles systems were set at conservative limits for the first operations and that caused many malfunctions
hubble is designed with safe modes so it can be the master of its own destiny in case contact with an orbiting communications system is lost for extended periods terry said
nasa had planned to release its first test image from the telescope on tuesday showing an open star cluster in the constellation carina
the telescope named for the late astronomer edwin p hubble will enable astronomers over its year working lifetime to look back  billion years and possibly determine the age of the universe
countdown clocks resumed ticking saturday for the shuttle discoverys delayed launch tuesday to boost the billion hubble space telescope into orbit
engineers also readied the shuttle columbia for rollout to its launch pad today for a may flight
the ships fivemember crew is set to blast off at  am pdt tuesday  days after the flight was grounded just four minutes before takeoff by a faulty hydraulic power steering unit
with discoverys launch processing on track engineers worked to ready columbia for its may  spacelab astronomy mission
the national aeronautics and space administration has not had two shuttles on the launch pad since columbia took off jan   with challenger poised on a pad  miles away
five hours later discoverys fivemember crew was scheduled to fly in from the johnson space center in houston to make final preparations for launch
commander loren j shriver  copilot charles f bolden  steven a hawley  bruce mccandless  and kathryn d sullivan  plan to launch the telescope wednesday
discoverys replacement auxiliary power unit was successfully test fired wednesday and the battery charging for the telescope was completed thursday one day ahead of schedule
the space shuttle discovery brought a thundering end to years of frustration when it blasted off tuesday to extend human vision to the very edge of the universe
the discovery roared to a record high orbit of  miles where its crew today will eversocarefully deploy the hubble space telescope billed as the finest optical instrument ever created a billion scope that is half a billion times more powerful than the human eye
seven years behind schedule the telescope will be deployed by astronaut steven hawley an astronomer on a day that many scientists were beginning to doubt they would ever see
its been long and frustrating conceded edward weiler program scientist for the national aeronautics and space administration who was visibly shaken by the launch
after  years astronomer eric chaisson of the space telescope science institute said with a sigh it has finally left the earth
high above the haze of the earths atmosphere the hubble is expected to produce images  times sharper than even the largest telescopes on earth today
after the deployment engineers at the goddard space flight center will begin the tedious process of activating the telescope
although scientific images that should tell much about the origin and evolution of the universe will not be released for several months there will be a few teasers early on
in about seven days the hubble should snap its first picture  what astronomers call first light for the telescope  but it will be primarily an engineering exercise and the image is not expected to amount to much
the image of a cluster of stars in the southern sky will be taken during the beginning of the focusing phase so it may not even be in focus
the stars may be so out of focus they look like doughnuts said caltechs james westphal principal scientist for the telescopes wide field camera
it will mark the moment when humans freed themselves from the fuzzy view from earth and looked to the heavens with absolute clarity
every bit of  years was worth it weiler said moments after discovery lifted off on a sunny day pierced a fleecy white cloud and emerged on the other side like a spacecraft on a journey to the future
they were here two weeks ago but when the launch was delayed because of a hydraulic problem they returned to their homes and many agencies had not budgeted for two trips to cape canaveral
there was only one small snag in the otherwise perfect launch when a valve failed to close automatically halting the countdown at  seconds before launch
but at  am pdt with air force col loren j shriver  sitting in the commanders seat the shuttle lifted off
this is the second flight for charles f bolden jr  the pilot and mission specialists bruce mccandless  and kathryn d sullivan 
sullivan and mccandless will be partially suited for a spacewalk today just in case anything goes wrong during the deployment of the telescope
the most anxious moments will come as hawley gently lifts the pound instrument out of its tight quarters in the cargo bay
the arm however tends to drift slightly so he will have his hands full keeping the telescope from banging into the sides of the payload bay as he lifts it
the solar arrays keep the telescopes hightech batteries charged and if they are not fully deployed within six hours after the telescope is lifted out of the cargo bay the batteries will have discharged to the point that some instruments in the telescope could be damaged
after the telescope is released and functioning on its own the discovery will back off about  miles and shepherd the scope around earth for two days
if anything goes wrong during that period the shuttle can rendezvous with the telescope and mccandless and sullivan can go out and work on the problem
the discovery astronauts triumphantly launched the billion hubble space telescope one orbit late today after lastditch commands from earth freed a stuck solar panel narrowly averting a daring emergency spacewalk
the telescope began orbiting earth every  minutes at an altitude of  miles  high above the atmosphere which has limited the view of groundbased telescopes
the event occurred a minute later as the shuttle slowly and carefully backed away as the telescope glinting in the sunlight drifted off on its year search for new worlds
the final hours before its release were a nightmare for ground controllers as they commanded the unfurling of two solar panels that power the telescopes instruments
we have confirmation that the solar array wing on the starboard side has been deployed the telescope control center in maryland said
the deployment of the two foot panels allowed sun power to flow into the telescopes batteries relieving worries that they would use up their eighthour charge
before astronaut steve hawley was able to lift the  ton telescope from the cargo bay with the shuttles mechanical arm its instruments had to be disconnected from the shuttles power and shifted over to the batteries
astronauts kathryn sullivan and bruce mccandless had put on spacesuits and entered an air lock in order to be ready to walk outside and pull out the array in case mechanical deployment of the solar panels failed
the first solar array unreeled from its mast at midday as the shuttle passed  miles above south americas eastern coast
hawley began the long process of releasing hubble shortly after  am pdt when he grasped the hubble with discoverys footlong mechanical arm and carefully hoisted the  ton telescope high above the shuttle
id like to pass on the quote of the day from the onboard astronomer  something to the effect that the big marble earth sure looks far away today shriver said of hawley
australian novelist peter carey was awarded the coveted booker prize for fiction tuesday night for his love story oscar and lucinda
a panel of five judges unanimously announced the award of the  prize after an minute deliberation during a banquet at londons ancient guildhall
carey who lives in sydney with his wife and son said in a brief speech that like the other five finalists he had been asked to attend with a short speech in his pocket in case he won
if id known i was going to win i think i would have taken a bit more trouble with my handwriting he said as he stared down at his notes
carey called the award a great honor and he thanked the prize sponsors for provoking so much passionate discussion about literature  perhaps there will be more tomorrow

japanese writer kazuo ishiguro won the  booker prize britains top literary award for his novel the remains of the day judges announced thursday
judges praised the novel a love story about a butlers english vacation as a cunningly structured and beautifully paced performance
other finalists this year were canadian margaret atwood for cats eye irish author john banville for book of evidence scotlands james kelman for a disaffection and english writers sybille bedford for jigsaw and rose tremain for restoration
after receiving the prize ishiguro paid tribute to salman rushdie the  runnerup for the award who went into hiding in february when he was threatened with death by moslems who said his novel the satanic verses blasphemed their faith
now that circumstances have changed when perhaps it is inconvenient for many people to support his writing i just felt it was fitting that we should not turn our backs on him ishiguro said
in announcing the winner the judges said the remains of the day renders with humor and pathos a memorable character and explores the large vexed themes of class tradition and duty
the booker prize is britains literary event of the year guaranteed to boost sales of the chosen novel after the award announcement oct  and dinner in londons ancient guildhall

this years finalists beryl bainbridge an awfully big adventure as byatt possession penelope fitzgerald the gate of angels john mcgahern amongst women brian moore lies of silence and mordecai richler solomon gursky was here
critic and novelist as byatt on tuesday won the booker prize britains most prestigious literary award for her tale of two young scholars investigating the lives of a pair of imaginary victorian poets
the five judges deliberated two hours before awarding the  prize to antonia byatt for possession one of six finalists in the yearold competition
television executive sir denis forman chairman of the judges panel announced the prize at a banquet in londons elizabethan guildhall seat of the citys lord mayor
there was very strong individual support for several books on the short list and finally possession by as byatt was the winner by a majority vote said the judges
the panel was unanimous however in agreeing that the standard of the other five novels was exceptionally high and this made their decision unusually interesting and unusually difficult
ms byatt who earlier this month won the  irish timesaer lingus prize for international fiction for the same work has published five novels since 
in possession she tells how two graduate students piece together the relationship and lives of two imaginary victorian poets from fragments of their letters and by retracing the poets journeys across england and to france

they have avoided dull and worthy classics and chosen six books which stirred the fin de siecle world and remain compelling today george du mauriers trilby anthony hopes the prisoner of zenda george moores esther waters kiplings jungle book george gissings in the year of jubilee and rl stevensons the ebb tide
the winner will be revealed on october  four days after the  booker prize ceremony at the cheltenham festival of literature
like todays booker prize it is a publishing gimmick everyman which is backing the spoof award is a significant publisher of classic victorian novels
of the  books trilby is the tale of a tonedeaf model who sings like an angel when mesmerised by the sinister hypnotist svengali then croaks like a crow when he dies during one of her concerts
on the  list romesh guneskeras reef is about a sri lankan servant boy and his mysterious master while jill paton walshs knowledge of angels reenacts the wolfchild legend
both for instance have books about colonial exploitation  stevensons the ebb tide and abdulrazak gurnahs paradise which is set in the first world war in german east africa
the controversial books of  were trilby with its louche vie boheme milieu and esther waters in which a yearold girl is seduced impregnated and offered the services of a professional baby killer for a fiver
it is now seen as moores best work but in  it had problems finding a publisher and the powerful circulating libraries refused to take it
last week a times critic complained about the inclusion of alan hollinghursts candid novel of homosexual love the folding star on the booker list because it offended judaeochristian ethics
but even if hollinghurst wins the booker his novel will not become the succes de scandale of esther waters and trilby which became the bestselling novel of the th century
today we accept the gap between literary writing such as hollinghursts and popular bestsellers by writers like jeffrey archer and barbara cartland
this is the gap the booker tries to bridge by giving highlevel publicity to works which would not normally reach a mass audience
the trick works  last years winner roddy doyles paddy clarke ha ha ha sold  hardback copies
novels accounted for  per cent of published books and no distinction was made between high and low art
in the mid th century dickens made pounds  for little dorrit the equivalent of nearly pounds  today
between  and  when the population of the uk was half that of today and the literate population smaller still mrs henry woods east lynne sold  copies
all the  booker writers were popular names they were also serious skilful writers whose books can be reread with pleasure  years later
socially the s reading public was a vastly more homogenous group than today a small number of middle class authors wrote for a middle class audience at a time when to be literate was to belong to an elite
modernism and the overturning of the traditional form by joyce and woolf weakened thcentury belief in the novel and encouraged the divergence between highbrow and lowbrow
the dominance of film and television has made novels a more marginal form and perhaps they no longer attract the most creative talents
george du maurier originally offered the outline of trilby to henry james who he thought would write a better novel
the fantasy element of fiction in which we identify with characters as if we know them was answered in the th century by the novel in the th century we have tv soaps
just as the tabloid newspapers feature characters from eastenders so when dickens the old curiosity shop was running as a serial there was widespread press speculation on whether little nell would die and readers wrote in begging for her to be saved
both in the year of jubilee and esther waters for example centre on the burning s debate about marriage feminism and the new woman yet both are also tearjerkers which everyone enjoyed
trilby is a tale of hypnotism and the unconscious a decade away from freud the ebb tide paved the way for conrads heart of darkness and the first questioning of colonial oppression
whereas the  titles had contemporary settings many of the  books are historical such as paradise or are driven by nostalgia such as beside the ocean of time
jungle book will get the retrospective vote because it is the bestknown today and has fashionable mythic overtones in the lost paradise of mowglis jungle its position on the list may also rescue it from schmaltzy disney associations and confirm it as a serious novel about a young mans selfdiscovery
softfocus ideologically shaky  in its antisemitic portrait of svengali  and sometimes sloppy it is a story of demonic possession and haunts the imagination like a fairy tale long after betterwritten works have faded from memory
like rebecca the popular novel by du mauriers granddaughter it is a natural equivalent of what the current booker prize seeks to create a combination of the classic and the bestseller
the shortlist of six for the pounds  booker prize for fiction announced yesterday immediately prompted the question who
the six include alan hollinghursts the folding star published by chatto and windus a melancholy study of homosexual obsession which was tipped as a likely candidate from the initial long list of  the reef granta by young sri lankan writer romesh gunesekera and how late it was how late secker and warburg by gritty glasgow realist james kelman which was almost universally wellreviewed
as for the other three  knowledge of angels green bay a philosophical fable by childrens author jill paton walsh paradise hamish hamilton by zanzibarborn writer abdulrazak gurnah and beside the ocean of time john murray by yearold orcadian poet george mackay brown  frankly they dont make the grade
the shortlist for the booker the uks most hyped literary prize and one of the most lucrative is all the more surprising in a bumper year for new fiction fulfilling the criteria  english language and nonamerican  for consideration for the award
margaret atwoods the robber bride seems an astonishing omission as do new novels by peter ackroyd peter carey candia mcwilliam william trevor and jim crace
but if the shortlist of the final six candidates for the prize may be disappointing the traditional controversy surrounding the award is as rife as ever
one unsurprising omission from the final selection was when the world was steady a first novel by claire messud which was on the long list before it was pointed out that the author was the wife of james wood chief literary reviewer of the guardian newspaper and a booker judge
professor john bayley chairman of the booker panel and husband of former booker prize winner dame iris murdoch expressed surprise at mr woods failure to reveal his relationship with ms messud
this list said one man of letters must have dealt a final death blow to the booker
after hours of heated deliberation  under a system described as mad by one judge  the pounds  booker prize for fiction last night went to mr james kelman for how late it was how late published by secker and warburg
the novel a story of scottish lowlife narrated largely in glaswegian dialect is unlikely to prove a popular choice with booksellers who have damned all six books shortlisted for the prize as boring elitist and  worst of all  unsaleable
professor john bayley chairman of the booker judges acknowledged that mr kelmans book in particular might be deemed inaccessible
rabbi julia neuberger the only woman on the judging panel said she was made extremely cross by the decision
in his acceptance speech mr kelman perceived by some as a scottish isolationist anticipated the criticism by declaring my culture and my language have the right to exist
one guest at the prizegiving dinner at londons guildhall mr salman rushdie who won the prize in  with midnights children remarked james kelman is good but not as good as he thinks he is
another judge mr james wood literary critic of the guardian was attacked for failing to reveal that a young novelist being considered for the award ms claire messud was in fact mrs james wood
the other contenders were the folding star by alan hollinghurst beside the ocean of time by george mackay brown paradise by abdulrazak gurnah reef by romesh gunesekera and knowledge of angels by jill paton walsh
in spite of heavy publicity the novels nominated have been selling  per cent less than last years shortlist
last years winner roddy doyles paddy clarke ha ha ha sold  copies
on the day of the big event ladbroke the large british betting agency posted the final odds
and for the last few weeks literary punters throughout the british isles have been placing bets on which of those writers would win the booker prize the bestknown bestliked and almost incidentally most prestigious fiction award in the land
in recent weeks the booker contenders have received almost as much press coverage as the charles and di rift
the betting is done largely by literary insiders says graham sharpe who sets the booker odds at william hill britains other big betting agency
last years winner the old devils by kingsley amis was a  favorite but this year anyone who chose the victor made some dough
im not a betting woman and i have slight reservations about books becoming a spectator sport she said in soft oxbridge tones
america has the pulitzer prize for fiction and the national book awards but in terms of excitement hoopla and manonthestreet interest theres nothing akin to the pound  booker prize
with the possible exception of frances respected prix goncourt theres nothing quite like it anywhere else
britons wryly compare the booker to the academy awards and though theres just one prize and no envelope similarities exist
as one judge noted wearily by august i was in more than a slight panic sometimes reading all day and evening reading while standing at the bus stop reading while cooking reading almost while talking on the telephone
next comes the shortlist the judges top six which was announced with great fanfare in late september
dutton  pages  peter ackroyds chatterton grove press  pages  nina bawdens circles of deceit st martins press  pages  iris murdochs rd novel the book and the brotherhood viking  pages  nigerian writer chinua achebes anthills of the savannah doubleday  pages  and moon tiger grove press  pages 
the awards presentation came on the last thursday in october and like any major awards presentation it came complete with limousines banquet salmon mousse champagne sorbet and english roast beef and television cameras
to be sure the ratings for the primetime broadcast didnt upstage those of eastenders britains popular soap opera
yet interest was sufficient for andre deutsch moon tigers british publisher to order up an additional  copies almost the minute mrs lively  and the nation  heard the news
by british standards sales figures for recent booker winners are stunning from the old devils  hardcover copies to anita brookners hotel du lac  copies
even keri hulmes the bone people a look at maori culture that most readers found impenetrable reached a respectable  in 
shortlisted authors are just a few paces behind sharing the bestseller list with dick francis and scott turow
heinemann initially printed  copies of anthills of the savannah the usual run for contemporary literary fiction
indeed theres currently talk of initiating a similar prize with a similar purse for the years best biography
another notable spinoff is the booker harpies readers intent on digesting all six titles then vigorously disputing the choices which never please everyone
this year the sunday times offered readers a complete autographed collection of the six books for the equivalent of  perfect fodder for the literary cocktail party cot
the wonderfully appropriate name comes from bookermcconnell plc the international food and agriculture conglomerate that puts up the prize money each year
the idea was to devise a british equivalent to the prix goncourt and like that august french award the booker attracted attention the minute it kicked up controversy
the early fuss was kept within the literary world with critics sniping over choices and the prizes varied ground rules
the real world took notice in  when elizabeth jane howard one of the three judges wrote a letter to the times claiming that in her opinion kingsley amiss ending up one of the shortlisted books was his best ever
but many credit the bookers current appeal to the  competition and thomas keneallys schindlers ark or schindlers list as it is known in the us
written as a novel the book told the true story of a remarkable german who saved the lives of hundreds of jews in concentration camps
oh yes moon tigers is a dying womans recollection of her life as a world war ii war correspondent and her affair with a young tank officer

mr michael stoney a senior executive in a number of maxwell companies is named as one of three people primarily responsible for more than pounds m of unusual payments from mirror group newspapers bank accounts during the last financial year according to the chairmans statement released with mgn accounts yesterday
mr kevin maxwell and mr ian maxwell two sons of the late robert maxwell are named as the other two people most involved in these transactions
mr kevin maxwell and mr stoney refused to provide mgn with information the statement says
sir robert clark chairman of mgn lists a series of transactions  some of which he stresses may have been perfectly legitimate  that took place in the past few months
he says legal action may be taken against a number of organisations including goldman sachs the us investment bank over more than pounds m in transfers from mgn if the bank was aware that they were effected for improper purposes
notes to the accounts show that mgn made extraordinary provisions of pounds m in the year to december   including pounds m in pension deficiencies and pounds m in transactions with maxwellcontrolled companies
sir robert says that during the year there were at least  unusual payments for more than pounds m from the groups bank accounts making a total of more than pounds m
the others were authorised mainly by mr kevin maxwell mr ian maxwell and mr michael stoney he says
one transfer to goldman sachs was countersigned by mr ernest burrington former managing director at the request of mr kevin maxwell on the reported instruction of robert maxwell
sir robert says the mgn directors do not believe that either mr burrington or mr guest knew there was anything improper about these payments
sir robert says the group finance department accepted assurances from the treasury department  which was headed by mr stoney  about the nature of certain transactions including payments to financial institutions which were recorded as deposits
the treasury department arranged for it to appear that sums of interest had been credited to the group in respect of those deposits he says
in his report sir robert points to certain weaknesses accepted by the mgn board internal controls and operating procedures which failed to identify related party transactions and bring them to the attention of independent directors for approval bank mandates authorised by robert maxwell and mr stoney which permitted the movement of group funds on the authority of maxwell or directors who were also directors of maxwellcontrolled companies the audit committee of nonexecutive directors which might have reviewed systems and mandates but was not convened the finance departments inadequate authority to verify and record the treasury departments activities
the report details a pounds m loan made by bankers trust in london last october which appears to have been used to pay off a loan from bankers trust in new york to robert maxwell group parent of the maxwell private interests separately the statement highlights three transfers of more than pounds m from mgn to goldman sachs  pounds m of this was transferred on robert maxwells signature to pay for previous dealings in maxwell communication corporation stock
the balance was for foreign exchange trade exposures incurred by bishopsgate investment trust and robert maxwell group it says
he says mgn is inquiring to see whether it can establish if goldman sachs was aware or should have been aware that the transfers had been effected for improper purposes
he says mgn is considering legal action against professional advisers in relation to property leases and hopes to recover money through claims on insurance policies written on robert maxwells life
about  banks became concerned last summer at the behaviour of businesses run by robert maxwell several months before he died and his business empire collapsed
their concern arose when maxwell communication corporation made late payments to them a financial times investigation has discovered
yet although some banks became alarmed at the implications for the financial health of his empire they did not discuss their concerns with each other or with authorities such as the bank of england
mr basil brookes mccs former finance director has described his shock to the ft at discovering last august that mcc had failed to settle foreign currency transactions with about  banks on time
starting about july   mccs treasury under the authority of maxwell and his son kevin had begun to buy and sell enormous amounts of foreign currencies
in these spot transactions mcc would buy a currency in one financial centre promising to make payment in another centre
on a number of occasions mcc received the currency but did not make the payment  thereby giving itself an unauthorised loan
mr brookes says about  banks including lloyds bank of america goldman sachs and swiss bank corporation were involved in the flurry of foreign exchange deals
one banker said attempts to raise money by making late payments in the foreign market was a relatively wellknown ruse with the nickname called teaming and lading
it also emerged yesterday that national westminster bank the biggest lender to the maxwell private companies felt badly let down by maxwell because he failed to deliver funds on time at the end of july
at a meeting between maxwell and mr john melbourn a natwest director on july  natwest refused maxwells request for a loan of pounds m
natwest was upset three weeks later when it provided funds  less than pounds m  to the maxwell empire on the understanding that it would be repaid the same day and then found that repayment was not made
the bank told both robert maxwell and mr kevin maxwell that it was concerned that repayment had not been made but it did not discuss the problem with other banks or with the bank of england
natwests loans to the maxwell empire now total pounds m half the level of two years ago
later last year robert maxwell made many repayments to banks by looting pension fund assets and also carrying out unusual fundraising exercises with us investment banks from which tens of millions of dollars were borrowed at a high price
documents which show for the first time that both mr robert maxwell and his son kevin were intimately involved in substantial purchases of shares in maxwell communication corporation one of their own public companies have been obtained by the financial times
meanwhile a director of a secretive swiss trust mr werner rechsteiner has broken his silence and has admitted that transfers of mcc shares to his trust which are at the centre of an investigation by the serious fraud office were made on the instructions of robert maxwell
this is the first time that mr rechsteiner has given details of the relationship between his mysterious trust yakosa finanzierungs and the maxwell family
the ft has also obtained a letter and has seen a corroborating fax which shows that mr kevin maxwell was intimately involved in the purchase of m shares by yakosa and a further m shares by servex another swiss trust
the mcc purchases by yakosa and servex are the object of an investigation by the sfo into an alleged illegal scheme to support the mcc share price
the sfo is also investigating whether mr robert maxwell or mr kevin maxwell breached the companies act by failing to disclose the purchases of the shares by the swiss trusts
if either had a financial interest in the swiss trusts the purchases should have been disclosed under company law because they were both directors of mcc
the documents demonstrate that bishopsgate investment trust a private uk company controlled by the maxwell family provided pounds m on behalf of the two swiss trusts so that they could pay for the mcc shares
mr rechsteiner yesterday broke the silence he has maintained since robert maxwells death in november on the subject of his relationship with the maxwell family
he also stressed that ownership of the mcc shares no longer rested with robert maxwell once they had been received by yakosa yakosa is owned by the maxwell foundation he said
mr rechsteiner refused to say who controlled the maxwell foundation which is based in liechtenstein but said it was neither robert nor kevin maxwell
the ft has however obtained documents showing that mr kevin maxwell was closely involved in the process of paying for m mcc shares on behalf of two swiss trusts yakosa and servex
on may  last year mr kevin maxwell sent a fax to mr larry wood an executive director of goldman sachs telling him that two parcels of m mcc shares each would be bought by the swiss trusts with pounds m provided by bit a maxwell private company
the fax signed by mr maxwell said that the funds would be remitted to goldman sachs by bishopsgate investment trust plc from its account at national westminter bank plc  lothbury
two other faxes sent by mr kevin maxwell to mr wood on the same day show that the former was equally involved in the other end of the transaction the sale of the m shares
the swiss trusts bought the shares using goldman as broker from two maxwell pension funds maxwell communication pension trustee works scheme and mirror group newspaper pension trustee works scheme
at pm on may  mr maxwell sent the two other faxes to mr wood on behalf of the two pension funds
as a director of mgpt and as a trustee of mccpt he told mr wood to pay each pension fund what it was owed to the natwest account of bit which mr maxwell described as nominee for the two pension funds
in other words he told mr wood that the shares were being bought for the swiss trusts with funds provided by bit and that these funds should then be sent by goldman back to bit
goldman then levied its commission and expenses on the deal of pounds  and wired the remainder back to bits natwest account
the late mr robert maxwell liked to think of himself as a strong  chess player and there was always a chess set in his suite in his london headquarters
there is no evidence to suggest that maxwell actually was a strong player or that he played in any tournaments said mr malcolm pein international chess master and director of chess and bridge which yesterday took over the business and assets of maxwell macmillan chess and bridge
and when pergamon was sold to elsevier last year maxwell kept the chess and bridge publishing businesses
mr pein said it had taken most of the year since mr maxwells death to prise the businesses which include chess monthly and bridge monthly from the administrators to the maxwell empire
price waterhouse took months and months to come up with any information about the company said mr pein
even when the new company had reached agreement to buy the business from price waterhouse administrator to the public maxwell companies they then ran into trouble with arthur andersen administrator to the private maxwell businesses
mr pein said the new company wanted to use and pay for the premises of maxwell macmillan chess and bridge  prefabricated buildings in the village of wheatley oxfordshire  until they found permanent premises
despite the year of difficulties chess and bridge is now set up in new premises in euston road london
sir nicholas lyell qc the attorneygeneral will attempt to stop the curtain rising on maxwell the musical the west end show chronicling the life and times of the late robert maxwell
fears that the musical might prejudice the criminal trial of the late publishers sons kevin and ian have prompted sir nicholas to apply to the high court on monday for an injunction to halt the production
the musical tells the tycoons life story through updated versions of familiar tunes from gilbert and sullivan
the attorneygenerals move to close down a west end production before its first night is regarded as without precedent
however it is no more unprecedented most lawyers say than the prospect of the maxwell brothers having to commute to their trial at the old bailey past a theatre advertising the story of their father as the musical review that will make you laugh sing  and be angry
the musical which has cost pounds m to put on has been produced by mr evan steadman a former chairman of one of maxwells private companies
mr steadman indicated yesterday he intended the show to go on and that the attorneygenerals application for an injunction would be contested
press coverage of the late publisher since his death has already caused deep concern to the maxwell brothers lawyers 
mr alun jones qc kevin maxwells barrister led calls for reporting restrictions to be placed on a recent high court ruling that robert maxwell had been fraudulent in his dealings with shares in berlitz the publishing company
turning down his request the judge asked him is it going to be your clients defence that mr robert maxwell was not guilty of misappropriation
two writs have been filed alleging that goldman sachs the usbased investment bank assisted in diverting pounds m from two pension schemes controlled by robert maxwell to ensure its own debts from maxwell interests would be repaid
the writs were filed late last week in the state supreme court in manhattan by trustees for mirror group newspapers pension scheme and maxwell communication corporation works pension scheme
the trustees seek more than dollars m for the sale of shares plus interest commission charges and punitive damages from goldman and mr eric sheinberg partner in charge of international equities trading
the writs centre on the purchase of pounds m of mcc shares from the pension schemes by two swiss trusts servex and yakosa which were transacted through goldman and for which the schemes were never paid
the writs also allege that on may    the same date mr kevin maxwell arranged for the pension fund share transaction to be paid for  goldman was due to receive dollars m for an unrelated transaction selling mcc stock to an unnamed american lawyer with close connections to robert maxwell
on april   they say mr kevin maxwell told mr sheinberg to sell the pension scheme shares to the swiss trusts
on may  he told goldman to remit the proceeds of the sale not to the pension schemes but to bishopsgate investment trust which goldman knew or should have known was controlled by the maxwell family
the writs allege that after the deal was struck mr trevor cook mgn pension fund administrator told goldman that proceeds of the sale should be paid to the pension scheme but when mr kevin maxwell ordered the proceeds to be paid to bit
the writs say that goldman and sheinberg made no reasonable effort to determine who had actual authority to direct for the pension fund that the shares be sold and where the more than dollars m in proceeds from the transfer of the m shares should go
goldman said it had received no money or other benefit from these transactions other than its brokerage commissions of pounds  which were substantially less than the amount of the applicable stamp duties paid to the inland revenue of pounds 
british media entrepreneur robert maxwell said monday that he is involved in negotiations to buy a us newspaper valued in the hundreds of millions of dollars
maxwell declined to identify the newspaper but his comments prompted industry speculation that it might be gannetts usa today tribune cos new york daily news or the chicago suntimes
maxwells comments were made to reporters at the annual meeting in new york of maxwells berlitz international and were confirmed later by a spokesman for maxwell communications the investors londonbased holding company
the daily news has one of the united states largest circulations but in recent years it has struggled to restore profitability and maintain circulation in a market with three other dailies
some analysts said it might make sense for maxwell to try to purchase usa today since it would mesh well with his efforts to print and distribute his monthold paneuropean englishlanguage paper the european in this country
other industry officials conjectured that maxwell might be talking to the chicago suntimes which has seen daily circulation slide more than  papers to about  since

the storey jijobhoy towers home of the bombay stock exchange was rocked by two powerful bombs last friday leaving  dead and  injured
it has had to compromise  trading has been restricted to an hour a day and dealing has moved back to the traditional ring where it stopped a year ago
but another bomb blast in calcutta triggered nervous selling yesterday and the index came back by  or  per cent to 
all this has taken place against a volatile background the bombay equity market over the past six weeks or so has had to contend first with unusually bullish speculation before the national budget on february  and subsequently with some savage expressions of disappointment
dr manmohan singh the indian finance minister disappointed traders in the budget at the end of last month
he postponed corporate tax reforms by a year denying hopes of a tax cut recommended by an expert group
he did reduce excise and import duties on a broad front but left out the cement and steel sectors where share prices had been boosted by prebudget speculation
to top it all dr singh refused to equate domestic investors with their overseas counterparts in taxing shortterm capital gains
he lowered the tax to  per cent from  per cent for expatriate indians and foreign investors but for local investors it remained at  per cent
taking the tax concessions for granted traders had driven up share prices in february to make a kill later
while industry and business welcomed the statement which for once did not propose any new tax professor rusi taraporewala the stock market theorist and academic said a reduction in import duties would leave corporate profits exgrowth this year
the relative lack of financial concessions meant that disappointed traders sold with a vengeance and until the weekend the market seemed bottomless as equity prices plummeted to a month low
overseas investors fuelled the downtrend as they sold some half a million shares of reliance industries arbitraging between the share price on the bombay stock exchange and the market price of its euroissue of global depository receipts gdrs
the opportunity arose after a change in indian regulations which allows international investors to convert gdrs into the underlying stock
at the current conversion rate of rs per us dollar the reliance gdr fetched rs per share against the bse quotation of rs
share prices rebounded last week taking the index to  and the uptrend on balance has continued this week in spite of the bomb blast on friday
they are hoping that foreign portfolio investment will pick up with the restoration of trading after black friday and the successful sale of reliance stock on the bse by international investors
the indian stock markets have been passing through a series of crises since december when activists of the bhartiya janta party pulled down the babri mosque at ayodhya sparking off communal riots
in this they are more fortunate than they were in previous years when they were under pressure to take advantage of a longterm capital gains tax exemption before the financial year ended in march
the exemption has been replaced by a flat  per cent tax this year which according to dealers puts bulls and bears on an even footing
india suffered a fresh wave of terror last night when an explosion destroyed two blocks of flats in the centre of the city of calcutta killing at least  people and injuring scores of others
police said a bomb exploded in the crowded trade and residential district of bowbazaar shortly after midnight causing two blocks of flats to collapse and trapping up to  people in the rubble
the identity of the bombers was unknown but the explosion comes just five days after over  people were killed and at least  injured in a series of bomb attacks aimed at the heart of the indian business capital of bombay
a militant sikh group fighting for independence for the indian state of punjab has claimed responsibility for the bombay blasts but police are unconvinced saying they were carried out by a foreign group in connivance with local criminals
in what many interpreted as a reference to pakistan with whom india has fought three wars last week mr shankarrao chavan the federal home interior minister told parliament in new delhi that he suspected an international conspiracy
most of the estimated  people living in the calcutta flats were in their beds when the blast occurred setting fire to both buildings according to officials in the citys central control room
last friday a series of car bombs exploded in bombay in what the government described as a systematic attack on indias commercial heart
among the targets were the bombay stock exchange the landmark air india building a shopping complex and two hotels near the airport
the attacks in calcutta and bombay are a severe setback to attempts to heal the wounds created by recent intercommunal violence which has caused deep shock throughout india
more than  people died in riots including over  in bombay after the razing of a mosque at ayodhya in northern india by hindu zealots on december 
some fear the wave of bomb attacks is designed to stir a renewal of communal strife and undermine efforts by the government of mr p v narasimha rao to open up the economy and attract foreign investment and tourism
last night national and local state leaders appealed for calm in an attempt to prevent a renewed outbreak of violence
mr teg bahadur thapar was serving lunch from his stall outside the bombay stock exchange on friday when he was showered with flying glass and broken concrete in one of  explosions which rocked the city and left at least  people killed and over  injured
those were caused by a traditional mix of crime political agitation and ancient hindumoslem hatreds stirred by the destruction of the mosque in ayodhya
fridays outrage by contrast bears the deadly stamp of hightechnology terrorism complete with semtex plastic explosive highgrade timers efficient organisation and money
the only comparable previous incident was the assassination in  of mr rajiv gandhi the former prime minister by sri lankas tamil tiger terrorists
but that was a single bomb aimed at one man  the explosions in bombay were designed to terrorise the nations commercial capital
mr p v narasimha rao the prime minister described the blasts as an attack on indias economy
the immediate assumption both at the highest level and in the streets of bombay was that those responsible must have been foreigners or had foreign help
but these suggestions were seen in bombay as a deliberate attempt to deflect attention from the people who in the popular mind are the real suspects  moslem extremists who might have taken revenge for the riots which hit india after the ayodhya mosques destruction and which left  dead including  in bombay
if moslems are found to have staged the attacks the indian authorities will certainly suspect that the operation was supported from a moslem country notably pakistan
breaking diplomatic relations would be the minimum step delhi could take on a dangerous road
mr rao chose his words carefully during his visit to bombay there is a definite possibility that our search may not stop within the country
workmen were clearing away rubble at the blast sites including the blackened stock exchange building
at the gymkhana club and dozens of other sports grounds hundreds of men and boys were playing cricket as they do every sunday
the stock exchange authorities plan to restart trading as soon as they can probably today  using an old trading floor the exchange vacated only last year
businessmen estimated the main loss to the city would be the loss of life and injuries and the damage caused to blasted buildings
some of the credit for the limited disruption should go the government and the police for promptly calling paramilitary and regular troops to help patrol sensitive districts
but much more should go to the people of bombay who so far at least have refused to be goaded into violent protest by the bombers
the indian government flew federal paramilitary troops into bombay last night after more than a dozen bombs exploded in the city killing about  people and injuring more than a thousand
among the targets were the bombay stock exchange the landmark air india building a shopping complex and two hotels near the airport
the identity of the bombers was unknown but the attacks were a severe setback to indias attempts to heal the wounds created by recent intercommunal violence which has caused deep shock throughout india
more than  people died in riots including over  in bombay after the razing of a mosque at ayodhya in northern india by hindu zealots on december 
the bombs appeared designed to stir a renewal of communal strife and to undermine efforts by the government of mr pv narasimha rao to open up the economy and attract foreign investment and tourism
one of the targets was close to the headquarters of shiv sena a hindu nationalist party accused of fomenting violence during the riots in which most victims were moslems
national and local state leaders appealed for calm in an attempt to prevent a renewed outbreak of violence
mr sharad pawar the former federal defence minister just reappointed chief minister of maharashtra state said all roads into bombay had been blocked and the army put on alert
mr shankarrao chavan the federal home interior minister told parliament in new delhi we suspect an international conspiracy
the indian high commission in london said the attacks were part of the externally supported terrorism which has targeted india for some time
the bomb attacks were spread throughout the city and were clearly aimed at the citys betteroff business people  in contrast to the riots in which victims were mainly poor
at the storey stock exchange building about  people were on the secondstorey trading floor when a bomb exploded in the underground car park hurling shards of glass across the floor and into the street
a row has erupted between the bombay stock exchange indias largest stock market and the securities and exchange board of india the securities watchdog over the boards recent firstever inspection of stockbrokers books
the sebi has accused stockbrokers of flouting the exchanges rules including regulations on margin trading designed to limit the risk of members defaulting through excessive speculative investments
the argument will do nothing to restore investors faith in the stock market where as measured by the bombay stock exchanges share index shares have fallen  per cent from their peak early last year including a  points fall since the governments budget was announced two weeks ago
foreign investors who are being wooed by india as a source of muchneeded capital will also be concerned at the latest allegations of poor management at the exchange
in one of its most damaging passages the inspectors report alleges that d s prabhoodas a leading firm headed by mr hemendra kothari a former bse president and by mr jaswant chotalal a member of the bses governing body avoided margin payments totalling rsm pounds m
mr kothari said yesterday that most of the transactions covered by the report were offexchange deals directly between financial institutions for which margin payments were not required
mr m r mayya the bses executive director said bse rules permitted such bilateral offexchange transactions
this weeks argument is only the latest in a series of disputes which began almost as soon as sebi started operations a year ago
they say rules must be applied flexibly and many firms are extremely small and unable to carry the cost of extra regulations
finance ministry officials believe loose regulations allow brokers and others to dodge taxes and also contributed to last years securities market scandal in which banks including the uks standard chartered bank lost a combined gross total of rsbn
kuwaiti and iraqi negotiators embraced warmly tuesday as they began talks on their oil and border dispute sources said

following its evening session attended by saadoon hamadi a member of the iraqi revolutionary council foreign minister esmat abdelmeguid of egypt told reporters the council would meet again friday
saddam promised mubarak two weeks ago that he would not invade kuwait in their oil dispute
at thursdays closed session hamadi reiterated iraqs claim its forces entered kuwait at the request of a kuwaiti revolutionary group that had overthrown the government
a conference source said several arab foreign ministers replied that they considered this to be an iraqi invasion which is against all united nations and arab league conventions
so far only lebanons prime minister and foreign minister salim hoss has joined kuwait in cairo in publicly condemning the invasion  the first time in modern history one arab country invaded another to take control of the government
the united nations security council has condemned the invasion and the issue is now being discussed within the framework of the arab league and we hope that it will issue a condemnation within the hour and that arabs stand against this invasion kuwaits awadi said
arab leaders must take the initiative and stop this bloodshed and return things to their normal situation
mena said kuwait invoked the  arab joint defense pact and asked the arab league council to dispatch a joint arab force to defend kuwait against the invasion
in the event of military aggression against any league member the pact all members to take individually and collectively all steps available including the use of armed force to repel the aggression and restore security and peace
iraq says it invaded kuwait at the request of a revolutionary organization there but diplomats dismiss that rationale as a largescale charade
the diplomatic world has remained largely unconviced by the flood of statements issued from iraq in the name of the provisional free kuwait government
britains un ambassador crispin tickell called the iraqi action an invasion from the outside  a phony coup detat from within
in a rare display of solidarity the united states and the soviet union called for iraq to withdraw and imposed sanctions
but iraqs deputy permanent un representative sabah talat kadrat said the security council should not be debating the issue because the fall of the kuwaiti emir sheik jaber alahmed alsabah was an internal matter
on the other hand staterun iraqi news agency from baghdad came alive with a series of communiques from the provisional government
the first statement said the provisional government finds that one of its primordial obligations is to remedy the harm done by the deposed corrupt government to our brothers in iraq
it has also accused kuwait of violating its oil production quotas set by the organization of petroleum exporting countries costing iraq of muchneeded revenues because oil is cheaper when supplies are higher
the statement on the iraqi news agency said the border dispute would be settled with fraternity and arab national interests indicating iraq would probably take the land it wants
the statement also said the alsabah family which had ruled kuwait for almost  years was working in concert with zionist and colonial powers to plot against iraq
falsification of elections authoritarianism persecution of patriotic personalities have always been characteristics of the alsabah family the statement said
a new national council with  members voted into office and  appointed by the emir took office after june elections
the invasion iraqs troops led by about  tanks crossed the border at dawn thursday and seized the kuwaiti palace and government buildings  miles away
the soldiers were also making sweeps through the southern oilfields according to residents and lloyds insurance service in london
diplomatic sources estimate more than  kuwaitis were killed or wounded mainly from the emiri guard which bore the main brunt of the invasion
the forces iraq a country of more than  million has the arab worlds most battletrained army and had massed more than  soldiers on the kuwaiti border
cause of conflict president saddam hussein of iraq accused kuwait of stealing oil from its territory and forcing down oil prices through overproduction
he froze iraqs assets in the united states and blocked almost all iraqi imports including oil
the order also froze kuwait property under us jurisdiction  a move intended to keep iraq from seizing it
oil prices soared in frenzied trading amid fears the invasion would reduce the supply of oil
iraqi president saddam hussein seemed determined to solve his financial problems and fulfill territorial ambitions by dethroning the government of neighboring kuwait
the invasion unprecedented in modern arab history reflected the brutality saddam has used to crush all opposition at home since coming to power in 
the sentence for criticizing saddam is death and the president considered kuwaits oil overproduction and the subsequent fall in the price of oil a personal affront to iraq
oh god almighty be witness that we have warned them he said last month after prices tumbled below  per barrel
he accused kuwait and the united arab emirates of costing iraq  billion in lost oil revenue by ignoring their quotas assigned by the organization of petroleum exporting countries
he also accused kuwait of stealing  billion by pumping oil from a disputed field that straddled their border and demanded that kuwait write off an estimated  billion it loaned iraq during the persian gulf war
saddam said he fought the war to protect the arabs from the fundamentalist revolution fomented by the late ayatollah ruhollah khomeini in persian mainly shiite moslem iran
never mind that iraq started the war in  by invading iran after a series of border skirmishes along the shattalarab waterway iraqs only outlet to the gulf
despite claims that the war was an unprecedented victory the long conflict stalled iraqs development dragging on for eight years
the war bills kept the government from delivering material benefits promised to the iraqi people directly after the war
tens of thousands of iraqi prisoners of war languish in iranian prisons and an estimated  iraqis were killed or wounded
despite its puny size kuwaits oil reserves almost match iraqs  billion barrels
by controlling kuwait saddam could help solve the financial hangover from the persian gulf war and fulfill iraqs longstanding wish for more gulf coastline
iraqs  troops massed at the border in the past few weeks were believed part of a pressure campaign to make kuwait capitulate to iraqs demands
but kuwaits pledge two weeks ago to obey new opec quotas and saddams promise to egyptian president hosni mubarak that he would not invade lulled the arab world into the sense the crisis was over
homage to the cause of arab unity has been paramount in middle east politics since postwar independence from colonial powers
although a civil war in yemen in the s brought egyptian and saudi arabian intervention on opposing sides no arab state has ever directly deposed the government of a fellow arab league member
despite iraqi claims that it is helping internal opposition liberate kuwait it has long coveted the tiny emirate
the iraqi government refused to recognize its independence in  and threatened to attack then but backed down when britain landed troops in kuwait
it proved the decadeold gulf cooperation council that groups saudi arabia bahrain qatar the united arab emirates oman and kuwait was toothless
while iraq was unlikely to invade saudi arabia it could use the precedent of kuwait to browbeat its neighbors on local policy issues
bombing an oil field would be a sufficient reminder of what happened to kuwait when it balked at iraqi demands
also in a region entirely ruled by absolute monarchs the fall of one makes the rest feel extremely vulnerable
in a series of bellicose statements in recent months saddam has sought to focus domestic attention outside iraq
in march he threatened to burn half of israel with iraqs chemical weapons  banned under international law  if iraq was attacked
it was a popular stance among arabs frustrated with the lack of progress toward peace and a palestinian nation in the arabisraeli conflict
weeks later police in europe impounded what they said was parts to a supergun capable of firing chemical or nuclear shells into israel
saddam has sought to inherit the mantle of the late egyptian president gamal abdel nassar as the leader of the arab world
asked the reason for the invasion kuwaits ambassador to washington sheik saud nasir alsabah said at a news conference ambition
the only direct saudi statement since the invasion was made by an anonymous government spokesman through the official saudi press agency the day after the iraqi move
it said saudi arabia was following the kuwait situation with extreme concern and that king fahd would be seeking to calm the situation and to find a solution in a manner ensuring the interests of all
the only tangible help saudi arabia gave the kuwait government was to shelter members of the ruling family including the emir sheik jaber alahmed alsabah and his crown prince
the saudis also allowed them briefly to operate a radio reportedly from a mobile van in the area around the saudikuwait border
but on friday the radio went off the air after a desperate call the people of kuwait appeal to you oh brethren oh arabs oh beloved brothers oh moslems rush rush to their help
it was not known if the radio had been discovered by the iraqis or shut down by the saudis to avoid provoking iraqi president saddam hussein at a time when fears were being expressed that he might invade saudi arabia as well
oil executives said saudi arabia has not and will not take the most potent action possible against iraq  closing the pipeline that carries iraqi oil for export across saudi arabia to the red sea
the executives said the saudis realize this would give the belligerent saddam an excuse to attack and occupy the saudi oil fields  miles south of kuwait giving iraq control of more oil than any other country in the world
turkey also has refused to comment about president bushs suggestion that turkey cut off iraqs oil pipeline to the mediterranean
two parallel pipelines pump iraqi crude oil to a terminal at yumurtalik at the eastern corner of turkeys mediterranean coast and constitute iraqs major oil export outlet

the six states issued a statement saying we strongly condemn and are very sorry for this attack that one arab state took against another arab state

saudi arabia was also one of the  members of the member arab league that condemned the invasion in the same terms as the gulf cooperation council
the arab league with onethird of its members voting against the resolution or abstaining was clearly unable to take any direct action
saudi arabia has been subdued in its reaction to iraqs invasion of kuwait which places iraqi forces near the oilrich kingdoms border
oil executives said saudi arabia has not and will not take the most potent action possible against iraq  closing the pipeline that carries iraqi oil for export across saudi arabia to the red sea

the only direct saudi statement since the invasion was made by an anonymous government spokesman through the official saudi press agency the day after the iraqi move
the statement said saudi arabia was following the kuwait situation with extreme concern and that king fahd would be seeking to calm the situation and to find a solution in a manner ensuring the interests of all

the saudis also allowed the kuwaiti royal family to briefly operate a radio reportedly from a mobile van in the area around the saudikuwait border
but friday the radio went off the air after a desperate call the people of kuwait appeal to you oh brethren oh arabs oh beloved brothers oh moslems rush rush to their help
it was not known if the radio had been discovered by the iraqis or shut down by the saudis to avoid provoking saddam at a time when fears were being expressed that he might invade saudi arabia as well

kuwaits us ambassador said the iraqis occupied all government buildings in the capital and were moving south toward the countrys oil facilities
the iraqi government of president saddam hussein claimed that it invaded at the request of revolutionaries who had already staged a coup and established the provisional government of free kuwait
baghdad television said iraq could withdraw its forces within days or weeks depending on how quickly the situation stabilized
the assault followed two weeks of tension between kuwait and iraq caused by iraqi accusations that kuwait stole oil from a disputed border area

world oil prices soared to their highest level in more than four years today as more countries joined the attempt to strangle baghdads economy and force it to withdraw its invasion troops
it has been pressing for higher oil prices to rebuild an economy damaged by the  war with iran and settle foreign debts of up to  billion
one of the reasons iraq gave for invading kuwait was kuwaiti reluctance to slow its flow of oil and push oil prices higher but it was iraqi oil that had slowed today

central intelligence agency director william webster even handdelivered certain fresh details on the iraqi buildup to national security adviser brent scowcroft
among the assessments he conveyed was a conclusion that by this week president saddam husseins force would be capable of penetrating kuwait or saudi arabia
but as the buildup grew the cia became more alarmed partly because mr hussein is so unpredictable and partly because unlike many other arab leaders he has been known to carry out his threats
greek divers have plunged  feet beneath the aegean sea and back into history finding a treasureladen turkish warship sunk by greek revolutionaries in 
the remains of the wooden sailing ship were found near the island of chios in the eastern aegean at a point where historical accounts place the sinking of the ottoman ship according to peter nicolaides a diver and salvage expert
the bourloti seimaz  or explosives invincible  was set afire and sunk by greek admiral constantine kanaris in revenge for turkish killing and looting on chios
thousands of islanders died in the turkish raids which shocked other nations and swung western european countries behind the greek struggle for independence from the ottoman empire
the french painter eugene delacroix produced a famous picture the massacre of chios based on the raids
its an incredible discovery straight out of the history book we used to read in school about the war of independence nicolaides said in an interview friday with the associated press
nicolaides who heard about the wreck while teaching an underwater archaeology course to local divers last winter started querying fishermen about where their nets snagged on seabed obstacles
when i dived i found ships timbers sticking out of the muddy seabed and dozens of objects  islamic cooking pots cannon balls a candlestick even a chalice from a greek orthodox church he said
according to historians more than  people  including  greek captives  were aboard the ship when kanaris staged his attack in the early hours of june  
this is a very significant very emotive find coming from this particular period of history said george papathanassopoulos the culture ministrys adviser on marine archaeology
papathanassopoulos said the foot water depth at the site will make investigation difficult since underwater archaeology rarely is attempted at depths over  feet but he said this is a ship that must be explored
nicolaides said he hoped it would be possible to tap american and turkish expertise to excavate the wreck as an international project
american experts from the institute of nautical archaeology at texas a  m university working in cooperation with turkish divers have pioneered underwater excavation off the turkish aegean coast
greek marine archaeologists focus on locating and surveying historic wrecks scattered around the aegean and rarely carry out excavations
a freighter carrying a cargo of beer sank in the north sea today off the dutch coast and all nine crew members were rescued from life rafts a coast guard spokesman said
it was not immediately clear what had caused the sinking  miles off the dutch island of ameland according to the coast guard spokesman who was not identified
the coast guard official who spoke in a dutch radio interview identified the ship involved as the finnishregistered freighter ra and said it had been carrying a cargo of beer
they were taken ashore by a west german helicopter from the island of borkum about  miles from the site of the sinking the official said
earlier reports had said that the ship was a passenger ferry possibly one of the dutch ships plying the frequent ferry lanes between the coastal islands and the dutch mainland
freight shipping in the area is also heavy because of its vicinity to the ports of delfzijl in the netherlands and emden in west germany
leopold gratz the president of parliament and one of the most powerful politicians in the socialist party resigned today over a scandal surrounding the mysterious sinking of ship  years ago
gratz  is the second senior socialist official to step down because of his alleged involvement in the socalled lucona scandal the subject of a widely publicized investigation by a parliamentary committee
interior minister karl blecha like gratz a onetime protege of former chancellor bruno kreisky resigned jan
blecha and gratz have denied wrongdoing or aiding udo proksch the prime suspect in the sinking of the ship lucona in the indian ocean
the insurance company has never paid claiming the cargo was only scrap metal and alleging the vessel was intentionally sunk to collect the insurance money
proksch wanted by austrian justice on suspicion of murder and insurance fraud has been variously described to be living in syria the philippines and latin america
in several interviews gratz described himself as a close friend of proksch but when proksch fled to escape prosecution gratz criticized him
gratz told parliament today he would give up his seat in february hence his post as president one of the most prestigious posts in austria
if it becomes impossible for the president to effectively take a stand on significant issues or to speak up on problems of parliamentarism because everybody is only interested in his context in a single other topic then he cannot serve the national council parliament in such a way as is his duty
in past newspaper stories gratz was accused of providing fabricated evidence from abroad to help proksch in his claim that the controversial shipment was for a uranium processing plant
an argentine supply ship that ran aground off antarctica sank tuesday in heavy seas and high winds the government said and there was concern oil in its hold could leak and damage the environment
the sinking of the foot bahia paraiso followed warnings from the us national science foundation that the unspoiled antarctic could face ecological disaster if the  gallons of diesel fuel aboard the ship were to spill
tourists aboard and the crew had been evacuated from the vessel which was  miles south of cape horn the tip of south america
the doublehulled oceanographic ship sank at about  pm the government news agency telam said citing a navy communique
the ship had been carrying supplies including jet fuel gasoline and canisters of compressed gases to the argentine esperanza station near the tip of the antarctic peninsula the national science foundation said in a statement released in washington
the ship ran aground saturday about two miles from palmer station a us research facility on the antarctic peninsula the continents tip
it sustained a footlong gash in its hull and some of the  gallons of diesel fuel began leaking washing ashore near palmer station
the fuel killed some krill a tiny shrimplike creature that is a vital part of the antarctic food chain and has affected penguins sea gulls and giant petrel birds the national science foundation statement said
agency spokesman jack renerie said tuesday before the ship sank that the leak which was threatening penguins and other wildlife had stopped
scientists are concerned that some research search projects may already have been affected by the leak a foundation statement said
telam quoted argentine navy sources as saying the fuel it carried both for itself and the antarctic stations was in steel drums so a spill is practically impossible
the  people aboard the ship when it ran aground including  passengers and  crew members were rescued by power boats and taken to palmer station
the passengers and most of the crew were taken by cruise ship to the south shetland islands from which they were airlifted to the south american mainland sunday
because the station is equipped for only  people food has been rationed to two meals a day a national science foundation statement said
two sailors were missing monday evening after a foot freighter en route from greece apparently sank in rough seas  miles southeast of cape cod
the  sailors from the star of alexandria were found on a lifeboat and picked up by the merchant ship ravenscraig coast guard petty officer randy midgett said in new york
the two missing sailors were believed to be on a life raft which was the object of a hunt monday evening by the foot ravenscraig and five navy and coast guard search planes officials said
the star of alexandria had been en route from athens greece to new york with a load of cement when it began taking on water in foot seas and winds up to  mph midgett said
the first mayday call went out at  am a coast guard jet from the air station on cape cod and a c plane from elizabeth city nc converged on the ship
the c was able to drop a radio into the water near the boat carrying the  crew members and they were able to establish communications midgett said
it was designed to carry bulk freight and was owned by caribene investments ltd of gibraltar according to bureau veritas a parisbased shipping registry
a yacht built for adolf hitler and sunk with great fanfare to commemorate the voyage of the damned was mistakenly dropped on a delicate coral reef in a shallow shipping lane officials said tuesday
the foot ostwind yacht was supposed to become an artificial reef in  feet of water about two miles off the coast
it was sunk june   years after the us coast guard turned away the ss st louis as its more than  jewish passengers were seeking refuge from the holocaust
the sinking site was supposed to be near where the coast guard intercepted the st louis whose passengers also were turned away by cuba and forced to return to europe
for unexplained reasons the ostwind was pushed off a barge about a mile north of the site and is resting in  feet of water on a living reef
 somebody made a mistake said mayor abe resnick a holocaust survivor and a sponsor of the event
they didnt even come close complained susan markely an administrator with dades environmental department
coast guard lt al crespo said the yacht is balanced on a delicate living reef threatening damage to coral and sponges
its also close to an anchoring spot for freighters and other vessels heading to the port of miami and has been marked with a flashing buoy he said
daly however said chris cadley captain of a passenger boat that accompanied him had agreed to lead him to the site
i thinks thats going to end up being decided by attorneys said ben mostkoff the countys artificial reef director
after world war ii the badly decayed boat wound up in the hands of a jacksonville marina owner
a deepsea inspection of the bismarck suggests that the most powerful battleship in adolf hitlers navy was scuttled by its own crew rather than sunk by the british in a celebrated battle underwater explorer robert d ballard said thursday
during a minute news conference ballard described how he his oceancrawling robot located the bismarck sitting upright and proud two weeks ago
then the american oceanographer whose father was of british background and whose mother was of german heritage addressed himself to the german people in german
he said he will disclose its exact location only to germany so germans themselves can decide whether to try to raise the ship which sank after a battle may  
ballard a senior scientist at the woods hole oceanographic institution in massachusetts said structural evidence satisfied him that the germans scuttled the battleship rather than trying to surrender or allowing her to be sent down by british fire
it is known that two years earlier hitler ordered the german pocket battleship graf spee scuttled after it was cornered in the neutral port of montevideo uruguay and attacked by british ships
hitler apparently wanted to keep the british from learning the secrets of the graf spees construction and weapons
in the  battle the bismarcks main guns were quickly knocked out and the attacking british ships were out of range of her secondary guns ballard said so its was helpless and taking hundreds of hits  its sinking clearly inevitable
asked if the german commander couldnt have surrendered by ceasing fire ballard said in the fuzz of battle in fierce seas it would have been unlikely that the british would have recognized that the germans were giving up
again he speculated perhaps the germans did not want the ships technologically advanced equipment to fall into british hands
before the battle british prime minister winston churchill had left convoys unprotected and thrown all his capital ships in pursuit with a ringing threeword command sink the bismarck
british ships picked up  survivors but left with hundreds of german sailors still in the icy waters after spotting what might have been a german uboat
if unstopped it could have posed a critical threat to convoys of merchant shipping and undercut british morale at a time when england stood virtually alone against combined german sea and air power
the british sent the warship hood after the bismarck but within five days of going to sea the bismarck had sunk the hood in a threeminute engagement with the loss of all but three of the vessels crew of 
the hood was a symbol of british sea power and its loss stunned the british public and the war government and made sinking the bismarck a mission of crucial importance
the sunken battleship was discovered and photographed by the same remotecontrolled robot that ballard used four years ago to find the wreck of the titanic the british passenger liner that sank in  after striking an iceberg
a florida couple said their pleasure boat was sunk by whales off costa rica and they survived  days at sea by eating raw fish and drinking purified water the us coast guard reported sunday
william butler  and simone butler  of miami were weak but recovering at a hospital in golfito costa rica after being rescued by a costa rican coast guard ship saturday afternoon said us coast guard chief petty officer egbert vallecillo
the survivors told authorities they lost about  pounds each from the ordeal said vallecillo who spoke to the couple by telephone early sunday
the us coast guards pacific command is headquartered in alameda  miles east of san francisco
william butler told coast guard officials their foot pleasure boat sibonay was attacked and sunk by several whales on june  about  miles southwest of costa rica
the couples last radio contact was june  when they talked to their daughter in miami the coast guard spokesman said
vallecillo said hed heard of boats running into marine mammals when theres poor visibility but isnt sure if there are any recorded cases of whale aggression
as the boat was sinking the couple said they grabbed fishing rods and a saltwater purifier and and got into a rubber lifeboat where they remained for the next two months vallecillo said
as the lifeboat drifted slowly eastward over two months the butlers said they caught between  and  pounds of fish and survived multiple shark attacks by sealing punctures with a raft repair kit
butler told us coast guard officials that several times the couple spotted merchant ships but were unable to flag them down
on saturday a coast guard ship making its fisheries patrol about  miles off the coast of golfito spotted the raft and rescued the couple
they were sailing from coral gables fla near miami to honolulu where they planned to vacation vallecillo said
their daughter sally smith and son bill butler were flying to costa rica on sunday evening to be reunited with their parents vallecillo said
bfn text buenos aires  may na  today the foreign ministry said that control operations carried out by the corvette spiro against a koreanflagged as received ship fishing illegally in argentine waters were carried out in accordance with international law and in coordination with the foreign ministry
the foreign ministry thus approved the intervention by the argentine corvette when it discovered the korean ship chin yuan hsing violating argentine jurisdictional waters on  may
the argentine navy reported today that the corvette spiro stayed near the korean ship given the adverse weather conditions and fulfilling its responsibilities of sea search and rescue
the korean ship which had been fishing illegally in argentine waters was sunk by its own crew after failing to answer to the argentine ships warnings
the crew was transferred to the chin chuan hsing which was sailing nearby and approached to rescue the crew of the sinking ship
the navy reported that around  nautical miles off the coast of malvinas and in accordance with bilateral agreements with great britain the spiro transferred assistance responsibility to british authorities
the foreign ministry said an understanding with the uk for operations in cases of uninterrupted persecution of illegally fishing ships was implemented
the foreign ministry also said the policy is in accordance with the growing international opinion currently giving priority to the preservation regulation and the sustainable use of marine live resources and the effective punishment of violators of national laws on the matter
but as the tragic sinking of the estonia with the loss of more than  lives demonstrates when they do go down the toll in human life can be high
as ferries increase in size so the numbers on board at risk from mechanical failure or a crew error go up
the move to rollon rolloff ferries with vehicle decks which run the entire length of the vessel has increased the risk that once the sea penetrates the hold through the bow doors or a gash in the ships side it can lead to the vessel capsizing
the united nations international maritime organisation imo and its members the shipowning nations have devoted much thought over the past two decades to ship safety
particularly worrying are the eyewitness reports which suggest that water penetrated the bow doors in a manner reminiscent of the sinking of the herald of free enterprise in 
unlike the herald the estonia appears to have had its doors closed but roros are undoubtedly very vulnerable to water penetration
additional stability could be provided by the addition of sponsons stabilising bulges which project from the ships side just above the water line
greater resistance to an influx of water could be obtained by installing moveable barriers or bulkheads to break up the large car decks
it calculated that it would cost between pounds m and pounds m to improve standards on the  vessels in the uk ferry fleet with a further pounds m in extra annual running costs
higher costs would inevitably lead to higher fares  unwelcome to ferry operators when on the short crosschannel routes they face competition from the channel tunnel
but the difficulty of pushing through fare rises would be nothing like as damaging to the ferry companies as another disaster
second the imo and national governments must look closely at how to improve enforcement of existing regulations
third the imo should be given support by national governments in its campaign launched yesterday to improve crew training
the european union which sweden and finland are getting ready to join could take a lead in speeding up the process
if the loss of a relatively modern passenger vessel in european waters can make shipping safety a higher priority for governments and the public this will be some small compensation for the loss of life from the estonia
retired sen john tower the defense secretarydesignate underwent surgery thursday to remove a colon polyp a hospital spokesman said
senator tower is resting comfortably and is listed in fair condition hospital spokesman steve habgood said thursday night
tower  a us senator from texas for  years was admitted to baylor university medical center on wednesday after undergoing a colonscopy examination last week that revealed the polyp habgood said
a preliminary biopsy of the polyp showed it was benign habgood said but further results would be announced friday by towers surgeon dr rd
further explanation of the first polyp removal would have to come from towers surgeon who was unavailable for comment thursday night the spokesman said
he also served as an arms negotiator for president reagan and he headed the white houses irancontra investigative panel
defense secretarydesignate john tower contradicted an earlier sworn statement when he told the senate his work for a british firm involved no military matters according to reports published saturday
one newspaper reported that several bizarre accidents including earlymorning car crashes and a hotel fire apparently were overlooked in the probe
the senate armed services committee has put the nomination of tower a former texas senator and onetime chairman of the committee on hold while it takes a second look at towers personal habits including his use of alcohol and his links to defense contractors
tower who has declined to be interviewed while his nomination is pending has denied in his senate testimony any problem with alcohol or any conflicts of interest concerning his business ties
a white house spokesman stephen hart declined on saturday to comment on the latest reports saying its the nomination before the committee
towers designated spokesman attorney paul eggers of dallas did not answer a reporters calls saturday
in written testimony to the senate panel on jan  tower said he could recall no actions in connection with any defense activities in connection with his work for the us subsidiary of british aerospace inc that statement according to two publications the los angeles times and the legal times did not square with information which tower provided to divorce attorneys working for his second wife in june of 
in the divorce deposition tower said he went to work for british aerospace eight weeks after resigning as the nations chief strategic arms negotiator and advised the company on how to sell training jets fighter planes and missile systems to the pentagon the los angeles times reported
tower told the senate committee he worked chiefly on selling commercial aircraft to us airlines and also advised the firm on trade legislation and currency fluctuations
the legal times said tower told the divorce attorneys that he was retained by british aerospace for his advice on how to sell weapons systems to the pentagon and that he listed the various weapons involved
the deposition was never filed in court because tower did not contest the divorce but a copy was obtained by the fbi the legal times said
the new york post reported saturday that the fbi apparently has not bothered to talk to towers neighbors examine certain police records or investigate several car accidents involving tower
the post citing syndicated columnist cody shearer said the incidents included an earlymorning episode on june   when tower was trapped in his hotel suite in dallas by a blaze he accidentally set by dropping a cigarette on an overstuffed armchair
the newspaper also said tower wrecked his car in two earlymorning accidents within weeks of one another in  and two years earlier he drove into a bicycle ridden by james patrick montoya son of the late sen joseph montoya dnm on his way home from work
fbi spokesman bill carter refused comment on specifics of the tower investigation but said we will follow any lead
on friday tower authorized the release of a statement that recent hospital tests showed no evidence of alcohol abuse and vice president dan quayle said i have never seen drinking being a factor in john towers life other than a social glass of wine
eggers meanwhile acknowledged that there was no question that tower sometimes drank too much in the early s but he said he is not an alcoholic
rep larry combest rtexas issued a terse statement tuesday supporting defensesecretary designate john tower but refused to comment on a published report that he told senate armed services committee leaders that tower used to drink up to a bottle of scotch at a sitting
an unidentified congressional source told the washington post that combests statement about towers drinking habits in the s came down on sen sam nunn the committee chairman like a ton of bricks and was a factor in nunns opposition to the nomination
the newspaper reported that combest later gave a different story to the fbi saying that tower and a group of friends  not tower alone  had frequently consumed a bottle of scotch
after meeting with staff and advisers combest who worked for thensen tower in the s issued a twosentence statement supporting his fellow texan
as a member of congress i have tremendous respect and full confidence in the senator and his abilities to lead this countrys armed forces
combest spokesman rich adams refused to comment further and said combest was not available to speak to reporters
the washington post reported that combest described for nunn and sen john w warner of virginia the ranking republican on the committee towers heavy drinking bouts in the s
a congressional source was quoted as saying that combest told the senators that tower would drink as much as a full bottle of scotch two or three times a week
trudi boyd combests administrative assistant told the post that combest originally went to nunn and warner to tell them tower had ended his previous excessive abuse of alcohol
boyd also told the post that a group of people drank the entire bottle of scotch not tower alone
combest  worked for tower for seven years  as a legislative assistant handling agricultural legislation and policy
the committee now controlled by democrats voted  along party lines last thursday to recommend the full senate reject towers nomination
the democraticcontrolled senate today rejected the nomination of former texas sen john tower as defense secretary delivering a major rebuke to president bush just  days into his term
the senates  vote came after a bitter and divisive debate focused on towers drinking habits behavior toward women and his business dealings with defense contractors
it was only the ninth time in  years that the senate has voted to reject a presidents cabinet choice and the only time it has done so early in a new administration
vice president dan quayle presided over the senate during the roll call underscoring bushs commitment to the nominee
kansas gop sen nancy kassebaum provided the biggest surprise of the final hours of debate when she became the sole republican to declare her opposition
she said her most serious concerns were over towers activities as a defense consultant after serving as an arms control negotiator
she also expressed doubts that he would pay enough attention to ensuring fairness for women in the military
towers republican defenders began to speak of him in the past tense and the nominee also appeared to accept defeat even before the roll was called
just moments ago i took a call from john tower said sen john warner of virginia the senior gop member of the senate armed services committee
senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine moved to repair damage caused by the bitter struggle to relations between the senate and president bush
dole agreed to a lateafternoon vote on the nomination after acknowledging the collapse of a lastminute bid to give tower an extraordinary sixmonth trial period as defense secretary to prove he could abstain from drinking
there was no doubt about the outcome as the senate went through the motions of debating the nomination through the final hours before the roll call
senators from both parties credited towers defeat to the decision to oppose him made by sen sam nunn dga chairman of the armed services committee
when he made his decision all the other democrats wheeled in behind him said sen john chafee rri with the prospect of defeat seemingly inevitable white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said if necessary well come up with a new candidate very rapidly
names most frequently mentioned in white house speculation as a replacement for tower if his nomination failed are sen warner a former secretary of the navy former defense secretary donald rumsfeld former rep jack edwards rala and national security adviser brent scowcroft
it must be clear to all that people like the chief of staff and the national security adviser any number of congressmen and senators and any number of other outside experts have candidates on the tip of their tongue fitzwater said
the most recent associated press survey showed  democrats and one republican committed to vote against tower or leaning strongly in that direction
the already slim chance tower would be confirmed was dealt a crushing blow on wednesday as a parade of previously undecided democratic senators announced they would vote no
only democrat lloyd bentsen of texas said he would vote yes joining just two other democrats who have made that decision
charles robb dva joseph lieberman dconn j bennett johnston dla dale bumpers dark and claiborne pell dri all said they would vote against tower
johnston said his reading of the fbi report on tower leaves him with the clear impression that towers personality changes when he drinks heavily leading to a recklessness in the social sense entirely different from his behavior when sober
for all the forecasts of dire results if the senate blocked towers path to the pentagon business is proceeding as usual
that doesnt undo the resentment among some of towers more ardent republican allies in the senate and in some corners of the white house
bush lieutenants claimed they had heard what sounded like assurances of support from a dozen senate democrats
nevertheless a week after the former texas senator was denied confirmation as secretary of defens the waters have closed
the goodbehavior rules set in the debate over towers drinking habits and his lucrative defense consulting business are certain to be invoked as precedents whenever republicans spot a democratic target
weve established what will be known as the tower standards said sen john warner rva that argument will be used by house republicans challenging the financial conduct of house speaker jim wright
he insisted that tower was the best man for the job and he spoke out repeatedly for his choice even after it was clear that the nomination was doomed
the  vote against tower was a setback to bush in the sense that it always is a defeat when congress denies a president something he wants
indeed it could turn out that the senate did the president a favor by sending tower back to texas instead of to the pentagon
it was a break bush could not make with a political ally who had been after the pentagon job since ronald reagan was elected president
and the reagan white house went to some lengths to rule the senator out of the job he sought declaring that the new president would not be nominating any senate republican for any cabinet post
after towers long wait bush displayed his own loyalty all the way to a losing vote when the standard somewhat safer course would have been to withdraw the nominee
republicans proposed that he get the job for a sixmonth trial and then return for reconfirmation a gimmick that would have changed the system and could have haunted the presidency
bush said he had been fighting for the right of a president to appoint his own cabinet but he avoided language that would have raised the political stakes
battling for the job he said withdrawal would damage bush and rejection would be damning the presidents judgment
towers advocates on the senate floor said grave constitutional issues were at stake that the authority of the presidency was on the line that the senate will come to rue the rules it wrote in the tower decision
sen sam nunn chairman of the armed services committee and the pivotal figure in the tower defeat agreed
walter r mears vice president and columnist for the associated press has reported on washington and national politics for more than  years
in the first eruption of controversy at a confirmation hearing for a bush administration cabinet nominee a prominent conservative told a senate panel tuesday that john tower may lack the moral character to be secretary of defense
over the course of many years i have encountered the nominee in a condition  lack of sobriety  as well as with women to whom he was not married conservative activist paul m weyrich told the senate armed services committee
criticism from weyrich and other witnesses prompted some committee members to temper the panels earlier praise for the former texas senator
but several members conceded that while their former colleague may not be the ideal candidate for the pentagons top job he probably will win senate approval anyway
weve had a surplus of rumors concerning the nominee and a shortage of witnesses with personal testimony and personal knowledge said committee chairman sam nunn dga
weyrich president of the conservative free congress foundation testified that towers behavior makes him unfit to lead the pentagon into an era of belttightening and management reform
in an extraordinary challenge to towers nomination weyrich also suggested that towers moral shortcomings could make him vulnerable to attempts by foreign governments to bring pressure on the united states government and on him personally
it is unrealistic to expect moral behavior in matters of public trust from someone who does not exhibit such behavior in his personal life weyrich said
tower  and twicedivorced served  years in the senate from texas including a tenure as chairman of the armed services committee from  to 
he has been dogged by reports that he is a harddrinker and a womanizer and that his hawkish views on defense do not square with the budgetary austerity that the pentagon faces
in announcing tower as his choice for the post on dec  president bush called the talk a lot of rumors that proved to be groundless
saying that nixon went to china bush added that towers record of support for pentagon spending hikes could be overturned
but weyrichs attack raised anew the issue of towers fitness for the job after two days of testimony last week in which tower won broad praise from committee members
ties to contractors fulbright institute scholar william c jackson jr and william g phillips president of the washingtonbased national council for industrial defense joined weyrich tuesday in opposing towers nomination
phillips echoed jacksons complaint that towers lucrative ties to defense contractors and past support for big defense budgets raise serious doubts that john tower is the best man for the job 
wondered why the president of the united states chose john tower for this job given the emphasis that he has placed on ethics and the appearance of wrongdoing said nebraska sen james j exon
sen john w warner rva in clarifying the grounds on which senate committees may assess presidential nominees told witnesses that it is not a function of the senate to say that this individual this nominee is the best man qualified
weyrich also told the committee that president bushs transition team received hundreds of letters opposing towers nomination some of which contain specific allegations of moral impropriety on the part of mr
in a closed session of the committee weyrich was unable to add to his own observations with more than hearsay according to sen malcolm wallop rwyo
but the allegation reviewed in advance by the committee prompted nunn and warner the panels ranking minority member to write white house counsel c boyden gray asking whether the allegations were investigated by the fbi and addressed in the bureaus report to the committee
wallop a tower supporter and a leading senate conservative termed it troublesome that innuendoes have been made the insinuations are on the table but the cameras do not record the fact that they are unsustainable
in open testimony weyrich also reflected widespread concerns among conservative activists that tower is not committed to the pentagons star wars missile defense program
the panel hopes to complete its deliberations by the end of this week nunn said and expects to meet once more today to consider towers nomination
in its renewed investigation of defense secretary nominee john tower the fbi is checking allegations that tower was recently involved in an episode of public drunkenness sources said friday  allegations that call into question his insistence that he has no current drinking problem
but a senior member of the armed services committee who asked not to be identified said friday that the new allegation if true suggests that the former texas senators drinking problem may be ongoing and that his confirmation remains in doubt
the charge received wednesday by the committee was very specific giving the date and place of the alleged incident and was made by an informant who identified herself a knowledgeable source said
the episode allegedly occurred within the last year at the monocle a capitol hill restaurant frequented by lawmakers lobbyists and congressional aides
two other allegations under scrutiny by the fbis special inquiries unit which is working around the clock this weekend on the tower matter involve assertions of another incident of public intoxication and of a recent affair with an unidentified dallas woman
if the new charges should be verified by the fbi towers nomination is doomed an authoritative committee source said
fbi agents spent two hours at the monocle friday interviewing the owner the maitre d bartenders and waiters the times learned
wine or tonic water but one source said that no one on the staff contradicted towers statement that in recent years he has moderated his onceheavy drinking and now drinks only an occasional glass of wine
none of the staff could recall any recent incident of improper behavior by tower at the restaurant sources said
on thursday the armed services committee had been set to approve the tower nomination but chairman sam nunn dga abruptly canceled the vote because of the new charges which he referred immediately to fbi director william s sessions
the bureau already had conducted an extensive background investigation of tower a year senate veteran who headed the armed services panel from  to 
no results until tuesday nunn said he did not expect the latest fbi inquiry to be completed until at least tuesday
some tower supporters complain that committee democrats are turning the confirmation process into a circus for partisan political reasons
this is terribly cruel to a man whos just sort of hanging out there said committee member malcolm wallop rwyo
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said that our feeling is simply that we believe he will be confirmed but that whenever there are any new concerns raised they need to be looked into
a senior white house staff member who asked not to be identified said administration officials were getting impatient with the delays in towers confirmation
house armed services committee chairman les aspin dwis said that the controversy has already hobbled towers ability to lead the pentagon effectively
this whole nomination process is going to present a problem for him at the pentagon in terms of running the place aspin said
tower urged to withdraw and two influential defense industry trade magazines on monday will call for tower to withdraw from consideration for the pentagon post
in an editorial prepared for mondays issue defense news a trade paper widely read by defense contractors and on capitol hill says withdrawal is necessary because the record of mr towers professional life raises substantive doubt that he can perform with utmost effectiveness 
army times another prominent defense community publication says tower is unsuited for the defense department post because of his work as a consultant to defense contractors shortly after leaving government service in 
tower has said that he was paid a total of more than  by six defense firms in the two years after leaving government service
towers profitable consulting work had raised concerns among a number of members of the armed services committee but did not appear to threaten his nomination
called morally unfit towers personal conduct however became an issue in the hearings on tuesday when conservative critic paul weyrich charged that the former senator was morally unfit for the post because of a history of drinking and womanizing
after a lengthy closed session in which tower was allowed to respond to weyrichs charges nunn asked the nominee publicly whether he had a problem with alcohol
staff writers ronald j ostrow robert l jackson melissa healy and james gerstenzang contributed to this story
the senate panel weighing john towers nomination to be defense secretary has found a substantial discrepancy in towers descriptions of his business dealings with a british aircraft and weapons manufacturer congressional sources said friday
tower testified last week that he had represented british aerospace inc only on civil aviation matters not as a consultant on military systems
but in a divorce deposition taken in june  tower stated that he had given the company advice on selling certain systems to the defense department
concerns about veracity the discrepancy sources said has prompted concerns about the veracity and completeness of towers testimony before the senate armed services committee the panel hearing testimony on his confirmation
and it raises the question of whether tower should have registered as a lobbyist for foreign interests under the foreign agents registration act they said
lawmakers from both parties have said they are concerned that there would be a continuing appearance of conflict of interest hanging over tower because of his employment by weapons firms which brought him at least  in   years  not including the more than  british aerospace paid him
in his testimony tower has described his lobbying and consulting work for a halfdozen us defense firms that do business with the pentagon
the addition of the british firm to the list would add another  and the first foreignbased firm  whose interests could pose a potential conflict
sources said the apparent discrepancy in testimony raises the prospect that tower could be recalled to testify under oath about his work for the firm
a lengthy fbi investigation into towers business dealings and his personal behavior has stalled a vote by the committee on his confirmation
the fbi is looking into new charges about towers alleged drinking womanizing and receipt of campaign contributions and has said that it cannot complete the inquiry for another  days
the fbi is trying to determine whether tower who left the senate in  after  years received illegal corporate campaign contributions from a military electronics firm that later became part of unisys corp sources said friday
the allegation was raised by a witness in the fbis massive ill wind probe into corruption in pentagon weaponsbuying
federal investigators have not uncovered any evidence that tower was aware that his  campaign fund received any illicit contributions from consultants employed by former unisys executive charles f gardner said to be a central figure in the pentagon bribery investigation
a unisys spokesman said friday that the company was conducting an internal inquiry into the matter but had found no evidence of involvement by current corporate employees
armed services committee chairman sam nunn dga and other committee members are said to be troubled by these issues and have indicated that they may vote against tower unless the apparent conflicts and questions are resolved
the sworn deposition about towers business dealings was never filed in court because tower chose not to contest the divorce from his second wife lilla burt cummings
but the document was obtained by the fbi as part of its background investigation of the nominee and is included in the committees file on tower
towers testimony tower told the committee in written and oral testimony that he was employed only by the american unit of british aerospace and that he worked chiefly on selling the companys commercial jets to us airlines
he said also that he advised the firm on us trade legislation and gave opinions on currency fluctuations
tower told the committee that he could recall no actions in connection with any defense activities and did not include his income from british aerospace among his earnings from consulting work done for defense contractors
in the divorce papers however tower said that he went to work for british aerospace inc on june   eight weeks after resigning as chief negotiator in the ussoviet strategic arms reductions talks in geneva
around the same time he entered into lucrative consulting arrangements with major defense firms including rockwell international inc textron inc ltv corp and martin marietta corp
he said he advised british aerospace on its chances of selling its training jets fighter planes and missile systems to the pentagon
deposition cites weapons among the british aerospace products tower tried to sell to us military officials were the tornado fighter the hawk trainer the rapier antiaircraft missile and the seawolf shortrange air defense missile for ships according to the deposition
he said in the document that he had been valuable to the firm because he was plugged in in this town and knows the defense business pretty well
the complex foreign agents registration act requires individuals working for or representing foreign entities in the united states to register with the justice department
in related developments  vice president dan quayle talking to reporters on a flight to florida said that he had known tower for eight years and i have never seen him inebriated
those of us who know him worked with him can attest to the fact that he has not had this problem it did not affect him when he was chairman of the senate armed services committee
when asked whether womanizing is a relevant topic for inquiry he replied you have to look at the qualifications of the secretary of defense
 towers doctor said friday that he has no evidence to indicate that the former texas senator suffered any medical symptoms of alcoholism
dr r d dignan who performed surgery to remove a polyp from towers colon on jan  said that after the operation he advised tower to limit his drinking to one or two glasses of wine with dinner
 a longtime bush political adviser said that bush knew what he was doing when he named tower to the post and would not withdraw the nomination despite the controversy
another victim was dr nicholas davies presidentelect of the american college of physicians a member industry group said dr louis felder who worked with davies at piedmont hospital in atlanta
none of the  passengers or three crew members aboard atlantic southeast airlines flight  survived
 the crash followed by one day the planehelicopter collision that killed sen john heinz of pennsylvania and six other people
 tower  and his daughter marian  boarded the passenger turboprop embraer  in atlanta and were headed to sea island off the georgia coast for a party in towers honor
the plane was descending in clear weather authorities said when it went down at  pm about three miles northeast of the runway at the brunswickglynco jetport
there was no cropping of trees said lt jack hopper of the glynn county police department quoting witnesses
 atlantic southeasts senior vice president john beiser said officials had no indication from the pilot that the flight was in trouble
 donald day the airlines manager of consumer affairs described the aircraft as extremely sophisticated and fuelefficient one of the backbones of our commuter fleet
the federal aviation administration subsequently ordered an inspection of all embraers for possible sheared or worn rivets in the tail sections
 towers death prompted words of grief and praise among his former colleagues on capitol hill even those who helped derail his elevation to the cabinet in  im deeply saddened by the loss of john tower a tough able friend and patriot said sen lloyd bentsen dtexas who broke ranks with most democrats to support president bushs nomination of the year senate veteran to be defense secretary
 senate armed services committee chairman sam nunn dga who led the successful fight against towers confirmation said america had lost a patriot
consequences reads a bit like a political stephen king story as the small senator swelled into a beltway monster
politics never has been for the squeamish but the tower controversy leaves a much more disagreeable taste than did the senators caperings which mostly took place in the s anyway
were the writing less stiff and the narrative technique less choppy consequences might have been a classic case study of late thcentury politics out of control
given mr towers qualifications for the job  intelligence patriotism and past chairmanship of the armed services committee  the nomination should have sailed through with flying colors
clearly and apparently to his surprise mr tower had made many enemies since his arrival in washington in  often rubbing even supporters the wrong way
once meeting with the editors of my newspaper which had backed him strongly he thought nothing of tilting back in his chair crossing his tiny wellshod feet atop the conference table
the new right activist paul weyrich claimed to have seen the senator consorting with a lady not his wife
it was reported that mr tower had chased a secretary around his desk and had fondled women at bergstrom air force base
the nominee issued fervent denials he drank only wine having long since sworn off scotch hed never chased secretaries his services for defenseindustry clients had been proper and modest
sen sam nunn mr towers successor as armed services committee chairman seemed initially to smile on the nomination then the rumor mill started churning and he changed fronts
while endeavoring to look statesmanlike sen nunn leaned on moderate democrats who would otherwise have supported tower
mr tower suggests instead that sen nunn a presidential hopeful discovered and seized an opportunity to show who was really no
sen nunn had every reason to know that the moral and ethical charges leveled at mr tower and investigated exhaustively by the fbi were flimsy
when the media retailed lurid and unsubstantiated stories sen nunn pursed his lips like a georgia sundayschool superintendent and suggested that a drunken mr tower might accidentally press the nuclear button
sam nunn mr tower insists used the fbi inquiries to discredit me and to strike at the president of the united states
there is sen ernest hollings a study in arrogance and pomposity sen james exon one of the most excessive regular boozers in the senate and nbcs andrea mitchell the most viciously partisan reporter ive ever seen along with the washington press corps
mr tower feels not without reason that he was arraigned on morals charges by cynical colleagues and media personages whom no one ever mistook for southern baptist deacons
the senate foreign relations committee today endorsed the nomination of michigan republican activist peter f secchia as ambassador to italy but the panels chairman said he feared secchia might embarrass the united states because of his penchant for making gross remarks
the committees vote was  in favor of secchia a former republican national committeeman for michigan and lumber industry executive
the chairman sen claiborne pell dri and sen alan cranston dcalif voted present meaning they took no position
pell inserted into the hearing record newspaper accounts containing the distasteful specifics of mr secchias remarks
at his confirmation hearing earlier this month secchia pledged to be far more careful as a diplomat in his use of colorful language than he had been in his different role as a political organizer and enthusiast
italian friends of mine telephoned me from rome aghast at the prospect of having mr secchia represent the united states in their country the chairman said
i believe that this nomination is a mistake and in all likelihood mr secchia will be an embarrasment to the administration and the united states pell said
but he said that since secchia is the presidents choice he would not try to block the nomination or delay action on it
joseph b gildenhorn the lawyer and real estate developer named by president bush as us ambassador to switzerland and his immediate family gave nearly  to republican campaigns since  disclosure statements show
gildenhorn according to senate sources is one of several bush ambassadorial nominees who have been rated unqualified by the american academy of diplomacy an organization composed of former high ranking diplomats including all living former secretaries of state
one of a lengthy and growing list of bush supporters and contributors named to diplomatic posts gildenhorn gave  during the  presidential campaign to the republican national state elections committee
the  contributions made between  and early this year by gildenhorn and members of his immediate family are being used by senate democrats to illustrate their complaint that too many gop contributors are being given choice diplomatic posts better reserved for foreign service professionals
a report prepared by the state department for the foreign relations committee said gildenhorn would make an excellent candidate for an ambassadorship because of his solid background in law and management
mr gildenhorn has been a strong republican supporter being a member of the eagles and team  the state department said
the republican eagles are contributors of  or more in a single year to the republican national committee while team  designates people who have donated  or more
gildenhorns political contributions are listed on a disclosure form submitted to the senate foreign relations committee which has set a hearing on the nomination for this week
additionally his wife alma lee gave  over the six years including  in  his daughter carolyn gave  his son michael gave  and his father oscar gildenhorn gave 
he gave  in  and  in  to the fund for the american future a bush political action committee and contributed the legal limit of  to the bush campaign in 
rudy boschwitz rminn bill cohen rmaine pete domenici rnm arlen specter rpa john warner rva orrin hatch rutah bob kasten rwis and former sen paula hawkins rfla gildenhorn  is a senior partner in brown gildenhorn and jacobs a law firm specializing in real estate
he is also president of the jbg real estate associates and jbg properties inc gildenhorn is also vice chairman of the board of directors of the sovran bank here
other ambassadorial nominees rated as unqualified by the american academy of diplomacy include florida real estate developer joseph zappala nominated as ambassador to spain melvin l sembler a real estate executive in florida named to be ambassador to australia and della m newman a seattle wash real estate broker named to be ambassador to new zealand
according to sen paul sarbanes dmd who first raised the issue of political contributions zappala and sembler each contributed more than  to republican candidates and causes
ambassador david popper president of the academy of diplomacy declined to confirm that gildenhorn and the other three nominees had been rated as unqualified to become ambassadors
but he said the academy does offer such ratings making its judgments based on a comparison of the nominees biography and the requirements of the job
he said the nonpartisan academy has no objections to political appointees as such but does believe political nominees should be qualified to run a complex embassy and represent the united states abroad with dignity respect and ability
twenty of  ambassadorial nomination made by bush in the first six months of his administration have gone to nonprofessionals many of them large contributors to republican causes committee sources said
sarbanes says the appointments are larding the diplomatic corps with amateurs rewarded for purely political services
i think the time has come very frankly to get off the money merrygoround and ask some very difficult questions essentially about when extensive political contributions are going to be a sufficient basis to gain an ambassadorial nomination sarbanes told the committee last month
its not true in every instance but in most of these cases you seem to have to be over the  mark in order to make the consideration list sarbanes said
ronald i spiers a veteran us diplomat will be the new undersecretarygeneral for general assembly affairs the topranking american post at the world body un officials said tuesday
he replaces joseph verner reed a banker who served in the post from  until leaving last winter to become chief of protocol for the united states
although spiers nomination as undersecretarygeneral for political and general assembly affairs and secretariat services had been an open secret for months secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar announced it was effective as of tuesday
spiers  is a career foreign service officer most recently serving as undersecretary of state for management since 
spiers has been a member of the us delegation to the united nations was director of political affairs for the us arms control and disarmament agency and was director of nato affairs for the state department
president bush has named career diplomat deane hinton as ambassador to panama the white house announced tuesday
hinton currently ambassador to costa rica replaces ambassador arthur h davis who was recalled by bush in protest of what the administration considered the stealing of the panamanian elections last may by gen manuel antonio noriega
bush sent davis back to panama city after the dec  invasion of panama by us forces and installation of guillermo endara as president
the appointment of the yearold hinton with his long expierience on latin american issues is seen as a signal of the importance bush is placing on restoring normal relations with panama
those relations steadily deteriorated after the united states indicted noriega once a ally particularly of the us intelligence community on drug trafficking charges in florida
he was assistant secretary of state for economic and business affairs from  to  and before that us representative to the nation european community headquartered in brussels a state department adviser on economic affairs and director and economic counselor of the state departments agency for economic development in chile and in guatemala
davis a former state department consultant and former ambassador to paraguay was sent to panama by president reagan in 
bush wanted to name his own ambassador and the time was appropriate with the installation of a new government in panama said one administration official
officials described hinton as an experienced latin america hand and a good person to have in place with the volatile developments in the south american country
on capitol hill senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine called hinton highly qualified for the post because of his wideranging experience and expertise in central america
however mitchell said he hoped bush would send the appointment to the senate after congress convenes jan  despite the nature of the recess appointment
president bush is expected to name a female career diplomat as us ambassador to nicaragua as that country prepares for a new era under presidentelect violeta chamorro according to informed sources
the sources said thursday it is virtually certain the appointment will go to melissa wells  currently ambassador to mozambique
they said the administration believed a female ambassador could relate better than a man to mrs chamorro who takes office wednesday
in choosing ms wells the administration passed over several male career diplomats with long experience in that region said the sources who asked not to be identified
wells name was submitted to the white house by secretary of state james a baker iii for the managua post and approval is considered  percent certain one source said
the sandinista government expelled thenus ambassador richard melton and seven other us diplomats on the grounds they were interfering in nicaraguas internal affairs
the reagan administration retaliated by expelling nicaraguan ambassador carlos tunnermann and seven of his subordinates from the nicaraguan embassy here
but a new era in usnicaraguan relations is expected to open with the inauguration of mrs chamorro who defeated president daniel ortega in elections this february
vice president dan quayle and a large congressional delegation are expected to represent bush at her inaugural
the administration has asked congress for  million in assistance to nicaragua part of which would be used for resettling contra rebels
but the request has been stalled by senate democrats some of whom believe that eastern europe has a greater claim on us resources than nicaragua
wells nomination as ambassador to mozambique in  encountered strong opposition from senate conservatives who held up the appointment for  months in protest against us policy toward that country
sen jesse helms rnc a leader of the campaign to hold up wells nomination said he wanted to pressure the administration into dealing with rightist guerrillas opposed to mozambiques marxist government
the bush administration is expected to name career diplomat harry shlaudeman as the first us ambassador to nicaragua in almost two years a us official says
the administration had planned to send another career diplomat melissa wells to managua but had a change of heart after concluding she might face a prolonged senate confirmation fight because she has been a target of conservatives
the administration is eager to have an ambassador in managua quickly because of the delicate political situation there now that usbacked president violeta chamorro has taken over after almost  years of rule by the leftist sandinista party
mrs chamorro faces the demanding challenges of reviving nicaraguas bankrupt economy and achieving national reconciliation after long years of warfare
at the time the sandinista government expelled ambassador richard melton and seven others at the embassy on grounds they were interfering in the countrys internal affairs
the reagan administration retaliated by expelling eight nicaraguan envoys in washington including ambassador carlos tunnermann
shlaudeman who has served as ambassador to argentina peru brazil and venezuela is a premier state department specialist on latin america and is expected to win easy senate confirmation
he retired from the foreign service a year ago but was called back to duty last fall to serve as a state department liaison with the nicaraguan contra rebels
shlaudeman who will turn  next week was approached by a senior state department official weeks ago about going to managua but said he was not interested
when bush telephoned him earlier this week shlaudeman agreed to the appointment the us official who spoke on condition of anonymity said wednesday
in addition to his ambassadorial posts shlaudeman was the top latin america aide to president ford in the mids and a diplomatic troubleshooter in central america under president reagan
the us official said sen jesse helms rnc and several of his conservative allies would not assure the administration that they would not delay wells nomination
they took the action as a means of expressing opposition to the reagan administrations friendship toward mozambiques marxist government
once the second man in the us embassy in cairo he also served in saudi arabia two african countries and a european nation
his choice for the new job signals the importance the united states attaches to jordan in terms of interarab politics and the arabisraeli dispute
before egans appointment became final he had to go through a grueling test in the us senate where senator daniel moynihan the zionist democrat from new york presided over the hearing that scrutinized the wouldbe ambassadors credentials and went on to confirm his nomination
in his testimony egan told the hearing he would work to develop relations between the united states and jordan and enhance jordans role in the peace process
he pointed out that jordan signed a joint agenda with israel that will presumably culminate in a peace treaty between the two countries
his said his top priority in amman will be to propel the peace process forward and recognize jordans energetic role in the effort to bring about a comprehensive middle east peace
mr egan will pay special attention to stability in jordan and watch its democratic march and economic development
he will also watch jordans approach to a number of other issues human rights compliance with the sanctions resolution against iraq terminating the boycott of us companies doing business with israel the potential for foreign investment both in jordan and elsewhere in the region and the fight against terrorism
much as i take exception to some of the issues that will engage the new ambassadors attention i concern myself here with a lecture moynihan delivered at the confirmation hearing
discussing the west bank and gaza he dismissed as inappropriate the designation attached to them as occupied territories and asked if these are occupied territories who were they occupied by
these territories contended the senator were never the sovereign domain of anyone it was jordan that occupied the west bank at the founding of the state of israel
however they do mirror an undeclared us line dictated by the allpowerful zionist lobby  a line that is now all but declared with the bizarre voting stance of the united states toward the un security council resolution condemning the hebron massacre
president bush filling a key overseas post has decided to nominate a former cia officer as ambassador to china sources said wednesday
the choice is james r lilley a career intelligence officer who served as cia station chief in china when bush headed the us liaison office there in 
word of the expected nomination came as bushs choice to be assistant secretary of state for latin america democratic political consultant bernard aronson ran into objections from several republican members of the senate foreign relations committee congressional aides said
 both expressed concern about aronsons appointment to secretary of state james a baker iii the aides said
may face tough questioning they said that it appears unlikely the senators would attempt to block aronsons nomination but said that the former jimmy carter aide will face tough questioning in his confirmation hearings
he has also served on the national security council staff as head of the unofficial us office in taiwan and as a deputy assistant secretary of state for east asia
in that job he was the principal american contact with south korean leaders during the turbulent period when former president chun doo hwan resigned and the current president roh tae woo won a bitterly contested election
returns to washington lilley left seoul last month and returned to washington hoping to be appointed as assistant secretary of state in charge of us policy in east asia and the pacific sources said
however he failed to get that job in part because newly appointed deputy secretary of state lawrence s eagleburger opposed him the sources said
president bush has decided to nominate john d negroponte a veteran diplomat who helped direct us aid to nicaraguan rebels to the key position of ambassador to mexico administration officials said thursday
negroponte a year foreign service veteran served as us ambassador to honduras from  through  when the cia was secretly funding the contras
but bush administration officials said they are confident that the mexican government of president carlos salinas de gortari will accept the nomination
can reject nomination under diplomatic practice the white house notifies other governments in advance of its choices for ambassadors
meanwhile bushs choice as assistant secretary of state for latin america democratic political consultant bernard aronson ran into objections from several republican members of the senate foreign relations committee congressional aides said
 both expressed concern about aronsons appointment to secretary of state james a baker iii the aides said
helms questioned the appointment of a democrat to the post and lugar expressed concern that aronson had no experience with the economic issues facing south america they said
the aides said it appears unlikely that the senators will attempt to block aronsons nomination but that the former aide to president jimmy carter will face tough questioning in his confirmation hearings
negroponte created controversy in honduras as a vigorous proponent of the thensecret contra effort and honduran opposition leaders who said he acted as though he were the governor of a colony dubbed him washingtons proconsul in the country
but he later concluded that it had been a mistake for the ronald reagan administration to aid the rebels secretly without building more public support for its policy in central america associates said
negroponte was most recently a deputy to lt gen colin l powell president reagans last national security adviser and had been an aide to henry a kissinger then national security adviser to president richard m nixon during the vietnam war in 
state department officials said that they had expected mexican leftists to register complaints about the appointment because of negropontes support of the contras but that they are confident that salinas government will not object formally
they will blow a little steam off in the press but i dont think the mexican government would dream of rejecting him one official said
three of president bushs ambassadorial nominees whom democrats said had no qualifications except political connections won narrow approval tuesday from the senate foreign relations committee
sen charles s robb dva joined the republican members as the panel first voted  to  to send to the senate floor the nomination of florida real estate developer joseph zappala to be ambassador to spain
then in voice votes the committee approved the equally controversial nominations of florida real estate developer marvin sembler to be ambassador to australia and della newman a seattle wash real estate broker to be ambassador to new zealand
robb said later that he was troubled over zappalas quite thin qualifications for the job but that he felt he had made an implicit commitment to vote for the nominee when he interviewed him may  and did not clearly indicate that he would oppose him
zappala reported to the committee that he contributed  last year to republican campaigns and gave  in the previous two years
his prior governmental experience described on the ambassadorial evaluation form submitted to the committee consisted mainly of chairing campaign finance committees for president bush and the republican party
other approvals in other action the committee routinely approved the nomination of shirley temple black to be ambassador to czechoslovakia
it also approved the nominations of thomas melady to be ambassador to the vatican william howard taft iv to be the permanent us representative on the council of the north atlantic treaty organization keith l brown to be ambassador to denmark and joseph gildenhorn a washington lawyer and real estate developer to be ambassador to switzerland
with the end of the cold war the un is playing an increasingly important role in working to resolve regional disputes
it has led efforts to end civil wars in el salvador and cambodia and it also helped monitor elections in namibia
last friday during an unprecedented un security council meeting of heads of state president bush reaffirmed the uns leading role in peacemaking
india and its neighbor pakistan remain embroiled in a long bitter feud that has the potential of becoming one of the worlds few remaining nuclear standoffs
he served at the un during the time the administration was involved in the delicate negotiations that led to the formation of the coalition against iraq in the persian gulf war and the un sanctions against saddam husseins regime
but some senior state department officials have been irritated by what they call mr pickerings propensity for the media spotlight
during the s when the reagan administration drew the line against communistbacked insurgences in central america mr pickering played an active role in that effort as us envoy to el salvador
mr perkins was the us ambassador to south africa in  when the us imposed economic sanctions against that nations whiteminority government to pressure it to end apartheid
mr perkins who is black traveled widely across south africa during this period making sure he was seen in black townships attending church services and funerals as well as in white communities
mr pickering reached over the weekend refused to comment on his future plans and mr perkins couldnt be reached

mark zimmer a meterologist at the national hurricane center reported an air force reconnaissance plane measured the barometric pressure at gilberts center at  inches at  pm edt on tuesday
the previous record low pressure of  inches was set by the  labor day hurricane that struck the florida keys with winds above  mph killing  people he said
with tropical storm force winds extending  miles north and  miles south of the hurricanes center gilbert also was one of the largest
but because the circumference of a hurricane changes so often during its course no records are kept on their overall size said center meterologist jesse moore
hurricane debby which barely crossed the  mph threshold to hurricane strength before striking mexico last month was probably about half that size moore said
gilbert is one of only three category  storms in the hemisphere since weather officials began keeping detailed records
the others were the  labor day hurricane and hurricane camille which bulldozed the mississippi coast with  mph winds and a foot wave in  leaving  billion in damage and  dead

the motion picture industrys most coveted award oscar was created  years ago and  of the statuettes have been produced so far
weighing  pounds and standing  inches tall oscar was created by metrogoldwynmayer studios art director cedric gibbons who went on to win  of the trophies
owens co chicago is made of britannia metal copper plate nickel plate and gold plate
according to the academy of motion pictures arts and sciences the only engraving mistake was in  when the best actor trophy given to spencer tracy for boys town read best actor dick tracy
the academy holds all the rights on the statue and reserves the right to buy back an oscar before someone takes it to a pawn shop said academy spokesman bob werden
what do charlie chaplin greta garbo cary grant alfred hitchcock and steven spielberg have in common
oscars year history is filled with examples of the film worlds highest achievers being overlooked by the academy of motion picture arts and sciences
the latest casualties are directors james l brooks whose movie broadcast news was nominated though he wasnt and spielberg who was left out in the cold with his empire of the sun
although broadcast news won seven major nominations including best picture and three acting categories brooks was strangely overlooked by the academys directing branch
since no movie has ever won a best picture oscar without its director at least being nominated the chances of the oncefavored broadcast news to be a big winner at the awards ceremony on april  have been significantly reduced
brooks did better in  when his terms of endearment took the lions share of oscars including best picture and director
some observers cite the fact that only  directors nominate for the academy awards and many are veterans who might not look kindly on the young man whose films are the biggest moneymakers in history jaws et raiders of the lost ark
the academy appeared to make amends last year by presenting spielberg with the irving thalberg award for consistently high quality of production
the recipients have included cecil b demille stanley kramer alfred hitchcock ingmar bergman and mervyn leroy
charlie chaplin received one at the first academy awards for his creation of the circus and again at the th awards for the incalculable effect he has had in making motion pictures the art form of this century
douglas fairbanks judy garland noel coward ernst lubitsch fred astaire gene kelly harold lloyd greta garbo maurice chevalier stan laurel cary grant lillian gish edward g robinson groucho marx howard hawks and jean renoir are others who have received honorary awards
id have to blacken my teeth first he quipped alluding to the academys fondness for actors who portray bums and downtrodden characters
alfred hitchcock also had a lighthearted comment on why he failed to win an oscar i suppose it was a matter of carelessness
 on polls of the greatest american films was nominated in  for best picture there were  nominees in those days for orson welles performance direction and coscripting with herman mankiewicz gregg tolands camera work plus art direction sound music and editing
billy wilders classic comedy some like it hot failed to be nominated as best picture as did chaplins modern times hawks red river and woody allens manhattan

hollywood ap  like all great contests the annual academy awards ceremony has generated a wealth of statistics and trivia over its  years of existence all carefully chronicled by oscar historians
oscar selection has come under scrutiny as film studios go to new lengths to pull votes out of the academy of motion picture arts and sciences
and with the flood of oscar vote enticements  from free coffee mugs to complimentary buffet dinners  academy members are acknowledging that some oscar voting is done by committee in violation of the rules
secretaries spouses and friends several academy members say are marking ballots in what is supposed to be the entertainment industrys most esteemed awards competition
its like a local election of judges said academy member harry clein who said hes witnessed team voting
dan lyle who oversees the oscar balloting for the accounting firm price waterhouse inc said that there is no guarantee that academy members have actually filled out their own ballots
more than  members were given ballots this year for the st annual academy awards which will be telecast on march  from the shrine auditorium in los angeles
since the voting is done secretly  members do not sign their ballots  the ballots authenticity is ensured solely by a numeric control number lyle said
ballots are invalidated only if there is more than one vote in a given category and only the votes in that specific category are not tallied he said
nominations for acting directing art direction and all specialized categories are handled by select branches and committees composed of academy members
all voting members of the academy can participate in the best picture nominations and may vote for the final awards in all categories
winners for best documentary feature best animated short film and best liveaction short film are chosen by only those members who have seen all the nominees
meanwhile other oscar voting rules are perhaps being broken speculates veteran academy member millard kaufman
although youre asked to vote in the nominations for five pictures i think a lot of people figure out that they have a better chance if they just vote for their own picture and leave the other four blank he said
given the tremendous impact both an oscar nomination and an oscar victory have on a films fortunes its not entirely surprising that a certain degree of artifice might surround the oscars
the last emperor took in  million close to half the films gross after it won last years best picture trophy
in the case of this years awards a flurry of academyoriented newspaper advertisements banquets complimentary gifts and photo mailings tied to five late releases appears to have been remarkably successful
this year all best picture nominees and the large majority of top acting nominees came from movies released in december the accidental tourist dangerous liaisons rain man and working girl were all released after dec 
while these five movies might be good the nearly complete exclusion of films from the rest of the year has highlighted the studios mastery of oscar marketing
i think the academy awards are crap said terry gilliam director of brazil and the current the adventures of baron munchausen
and at least one prominent academy member director carl reiner says that the manipulation of oscar voters has reached new depths
reiner said that universal studios allout effort to bag votes for sigourney weaver a best actress nominee for gorillas in the mist could lead him to vote against the film
i have in my house more color reproductions of sigourney weaver and a beautiful gorilla than i need reiner said of promotional material sent to his home
with oscar statuettes selling at auction for more than  and a chicago trophy company casting alleged academy award clones the national academy of motion picture arts and sciences is scrambling to make sure oscars golden sheen isnt tarnished by hollywood hucksterism
if you know about an infringement and fail to object to it you risk having your trademark become public domain said bruce davis the academys executive administrator in explaining the lawsuits the organization has filed to protect its beloved hunk of electroplated pewter
but despite the academys crusade against crass commercialism this years awards ceremony will feature a new merchandising wrinkle some  limousines delivering the most famous stars to the oscar telecast will be equipped with doormounted coolers jammed with diet coke cocacola classic and other cocacola co beverages
when the limo doors swing open in front of the shrine auditorium and the celebrities tumble out the coke logo will be on display in front of an audience that includes millions around the world
the academy approached our local bottler in los angeles and said were going to have a lot of thirsty people
but even as the academy embraces this new intrusion of merchandising it has lashed out at whatever else it considers a blemishing of the oscar name
when mgmua the distributor of rain man published newspaper advertisements touting the films oscar nominations before the nominations were even announced the academy issued a harsh statement condemning mgmuas promotional gamble
the collectors book store local sponsors of monthly entertainment memorabilia auctions has sold off seven oscars in the past year including the best picture trophy for s an american in paris  marlon brandos best actor prize for s on the waterfront  and the black and white interior decoration oscar for s how green was my valley 
none were sold by the original recipients heirs or friends who had later received the trophies put them on the block
when malcolm willits the book stores owner announced that he would hold a february auction for the  bestpicture trophy for around the world in  days the academy said enough initiating a court action that for now has blocked any future trophy sales
the academy insists that a contract signed by oscar winners mandates that they will not sell the trophies without first offering them to the academy for a nominal fee
the nobel prize might be a greater honor but people know more about what an academy award looks like
 twenty years ago you wouldnt have a movie poster in your living room unless you were a college student

yet the academy has lost its most recent attempt to save its trophys integrity a copyright infringement suit brought against the houston international film festival was dismissed march  in a california federal court

the oscar statuette one of the most recognizable images in the entertainment world has no copyright protection a federal judge has ruled
the small academy award statue is part of the public domain us district court judge laughlin waters said in a ruling released thursday
the decision was a setback for the academy of motion picture arts and sciences which had sued a chicagobased manufacturer of an employeeincentive trophy similar to the oscar
the academy claimed that the star award the trophy lookalike made by creative house promotions violated copyright laws diluted the academys trademark and represented unfair competition
the star award depicted a naked muscular male much like the oscar just two inches shorter and holding a star instead of a sword
it had a gold finish similar to the oscar and stood on a circular gold cap mounted on a cylindrical base
although waters acknowledged that the creative house trophy is very similar to the oscar he rejected all of the academys legal claims saying that the statuette became part of the public domain prior to jan   the effective date of the copyright act of 
the film industrys top award was distributed from the first ceremony in  until about  without the c mark indicating a copyright
the judge ruled too that the oscar not only was an honorary award but also was used to promote the film industry and therefore did not have a limited purpose as required by the copyright act
the academy noted that the ruling applied only to the statuette and that the academys trademark and service marks for the oscar and the academy award names and symbols are unaffected
we are surprised that the court would base its decision on events which occurred half a century ago overlooking the meticulous fashion in which the academy has protected the integrity of its institutional symbol for decades malden said in a statement
spike lee may have been wearing a georgetown university cap and sweatshirt but he got a far warmer reception from syracuse university students than he did from academy award voters
in a lecture and questionandanswer session monday lee shrugged off the academys icy treatment of his latest movie do the right thing and blamed it on generational politics
the  film widely hailed by critics received only two academy award nominations and isnt being considered for best picture or best director
he said they were a lot more comfortable with the black chauffeur in driving miss daisy than with the angry characters in his film
asked if racism might have been involved in the academy nominations lee replied racisms involved in everything
hes an africanamerican one of the first ones to make it as a producer and director and hes addressing the issues and concerns affecting our community syracuse senior deron harris said
well it did turn out to be rain mans evening but not until the last few minutes and if there was a message in wednesday nights academy awards results its that parity has returned to hollywood
for twothirds of the show the academy voters seemed determined to give an award to every film nominated
rain man did win the grand prize and three other big ones and mississippi burning with just one oscar for cinematography did get punished for its highly publicized historical muddling
but gone for a refreshing change was the slate voting that has turned many recent academy awards shows into onenote evenings that kept some deserving people out of the oscar resale market
rain man its director barry levinson hoffman and the screenwriters the two of several who worked on it may have fulfilled their roles as favorites but there were no sure things elsewhere and people looking for early patterns had to throw away the form
the final score shows rain man with four oscars and dangerous liaisons and who framed roger rabbit with three each
whether the spread represents a change in voting habits or an absence of a film to rally around it made for a great show and in some cases the awards helped right some wrongs in the nominations process
that who framed roger rabbit won three of the six awards for which it was nominated may save the academy some embarrassment for neglecting the one  film sure to be regarded as a classic
the voters tend to favor those films that are both of substance and commercially successful thus rain man and whether they even bother to see the other nominees is often questioned
this year several winners came from films that failed to ring up big numbers at the box office jodie foster as best actress from the accused geena davis as best supporting actress from the accidental tourist
more surprising were the awards given to bird and the milagro beanfield war films that divided critics and sent moviegoers off to the video store looking for alternatives
both films were flawed but the sound editing done for bird which seamlessly blended old jazz recordings with fresh studio cuts done by contemporary musicians was brilliant and deserved the award its fourman sound team won
david grusins oscar for scoring the milagro beanfield war overcame even bigger odds winning over popular john williams score for the accidental tourist
the selective mood of the voters is a reflection of the kind of year the film industry had and whether the spread is a quirk one can hope it suggests a trend
the industry is still adjusting to its changing  its older and more demanding audience  and that means a wider variety of films
who would have thought that snow white of all people would become the source of oscar nights only major glitch
the walt disney co filed suit in los angeles federal court thursday against the academy of motion picture arts and sciences charging copyright infringement of its snow white character and unfair competition
the famous fairy tale character portrayed by singerdancer eileen bowman opened wednesday nights academy awards ceremonies with an elaborate minute songanddance routine
we have great respect for the academy and for all that it does frank wells disneys president and chief operating officer said thursday in a prepared statement
we were therefore greatly surprised and dismayed when we viewed last evenings academy awards ceremonies to see that our snow white character had been used extensively without our permission
wells said the suit was filed only after the company asked the academy to publicly apologize for its unauthorized use of the character which debuted in a  fulllength cartoon film
disney spokesman erwin okun did not provide any details of thursdays negotiations with academy officials over an apology except to say that the academys offer was not to our satisfaction
bruce davis the academys executive administrator declined comment saying top officials needed time to assess the suit
we havent gotten any official notification of this davis said adding that he learned of the legal action from a reporter
ironically the academy is extremely protective of the oscar name and statuette copyrights and is quick to object to the images unauthorized use
number kept secret alan carr who produced the oscar show had ordered that the details of the opening number be kept secret until wednesday nights abc telecast
at that point the disney statement said the academy through a legal representative denied to disney that the academy award program contained any material deleterious to the interests of disney without revealing the academys intention to feature disneys snow white
the snow white character  as portrayed wednesday night by bowman  was created by steve silver who for  years has used the character in the san francisco musical revue beach blanket babylon
disney files dozens of suits a year against individuals and companies that copy its characters particularly in consumer products
but okun said the company which won four oscars wednesday night has never sued silver over his use of the snow white character in that production
new treatments that stop a heart attack in its tracks may help victims to get out of the hospital more quickly than ever before perhaps even three days after their attacks a study published today concludes

when given quickly after a heart attack tpa can dissolve clots in the hearts arteries and minimize damage
the report represents the latest in a steady threedecade trend of sending heart attack patients home from the hospital after ever shorter stays
however the study in the new england journal of medicine said more research is needed before the findings are widely adopted
in the s doctors often recommended that patients stay in bed for one to two months after a heart attack
when president dwight d eisenhower suffered an uncomplicated heart attack in  he spent seven weeks recovering in the hospital
in their paper the doctors determined that  of the  heart attack patients studied were healthy enough to be considered for early discharge
however people in the early discharge group were able to return to work about two weeks sooner than the others and their medical bills were significantly lower   versus 
the researchers estimated that if  percent of all heart attack patients were discharged after three days the annual saving would be at least  million
in an accompanying editorial dr gregory d curfman a deputy editor of the journal cautioned that the study was not large enough to spot complications that might result from reducing hospital stays
this single study he wrote is not sufficient to justify sweeping changes in current management practices for all patients who may at first appear to have uncomplicated heart attacks
a drug used to treat patients complaining of chest pain also could help prevent recurring heart attacks in four out of five heart patients according to a study published in todays edition of the new england journal of medicine
surprisingly however the study found that the drug diltiazem increases the chance of a subsequent heart attack in patients whose hearts pump abnormally experts said
even so the results may trigger an increase in the use of the drug which is now primarily used to treat angina doctors said
the drug was tested in  hospitals in the united states and canada on patients who had recently suffered a heart attack said dr arthur moss a clinical professor of medicine at the university of rochester and the principal investigator for the study
the results suggest the drug may be quite effective in decreasing the likelihood of a second heart attack in the majority of patients moss said
but the study also surprisingly suggests that patients who suffer pulmonary congestion should not be given diltiazem because the drug increases the chance of a subsequent heart attack
diltiazem is a calcium entry blocker the newest class of drugs to be introduced in the fight against heart disease
the study involved  heart attack patients who were given either  milligrams of diltiazem a day or a placebo
overall the drug only decreased additional heart attacks  percent which was not statistically significant moss said
but in patients who had normal or nearnormal heart pump function   patients or  percent of the total group  diltiazem decreased the chance of another heart attack by  percent moss said
in patients whose hearts had pumping problems the drug not only didnt help but it increased the chance of a heart attack by  percent
dr john schroeder a cardiologist and professor at stanford university said he was surprised that the drug increased the chance of heart attack in any group and that overall results were not higher
dr george beller a cardiologist and professor at the university of virginia said he was also somewhat surprised about the increase in heart attacks in the group suffering pulmonary congestion
diltiazem and two other calcium entry blockers were introduced in the past decade beller said and research into how effective they are in various applications is in its early stages
a study of more than  male doctors had shown that taking a single aspirin every other day could cut heart attack risk in half
the study was one of a series of recent reports showing for the first time that doctors are able not only to treat heart attacks  but also to prevent them
in the most recent report doctors found that one aspirin tablet and a single dose of a clotdissolving drug given within  hours can dramatically cut the risk of a second fatal heart attack
without the treatment patients had a  percent chance of dying from a second heart attack within five weeks the researchers found
the real discovery is that treatment for patients is going to reduce inhospital mortality substantially says richard peto of oxford university one of the studys authors
to put it another way of the  american who died that year more than one in three died of heart disease
the drugs most responsible for the recent success in preventing heart attacks are the new clotdissolvers and that old standby aspirin
the usual cause of heart attacks is a blockage of the coronary arteries which supply the heart muscle with oxygenrich blood
aspirin interferes with aspects of the clotting process helping to prevent clot formation in the first place
the limited sales of the clotdissolving drugs in the united states show that many doctors are still not using them despite their proven success
some doctors predict that in the nottoodistant future these drugs will be judged so safe that they will be administered routinely by paramedics in ambulances before suspected heart attack victims even reach the hospital
we have to know how to respond quickly and we have to have the courage to use these drugs in the absence of definitive diagnosis says dr burton sobel of washington university in st louis a pioneer in the testing of the clotdissolvers
while most public attention has focused on this new ability to prevent heart attacks researchers have also made important progress in speeding the recovery of patients who survive heart attacks
researchers at the university of michigan recently determined that some heart attack victims can be released from the hospital as soon as three days after their heart attacks
the patients given early discharge were able to return to work two weeks sooner than others in the study group
the researchers concluded that perhaps  percent of heart attacks victims could be safely discharged after three days
in july stanford university doctors found that workers who went back to their jobs about seven weeks after their heart attacks did at least as well as workers who went back after a more typical convalescence of about  or  weeks
all of these advances come at a time when public health experts are increasingly emphasizing the role of good health and good nutrition in lowering heart disease risk
early next year the american heart association seal of approval will begin appearing on foods that are low in fat and cholesterol and therefore can help reduce heart disease risk
surgeon general c everett koop in july issued his first report on nutrition calling on americans to lower their consumption of fats and to eat more vegetables fruits fish poultry and whole grains
the report has been likened to the first surgeon generals report on smoking issued in  which focused public attention on smokings hazards
koops recommendations largely echo those of the american heart association but they should help carry the message to many more people
progress in research on heart disease is making clear that the heart attack is no longer a mysterious killer that strikes without warning and cannot be defended against
much can be done to prevent heart attacks great improvements are being made in treatments and recovery is faster than ever before
the use of a clotdissolver and aspirin could alone save  lives a year in the united states doctors say
these results says dr peter sleight of oxford university will change medical practice worldwide
the expensive practice of using balloon catheters to force open heart arteries immediately after heart attacks now routinely done at many large hospitals is unnecessary and should be abandoned according to a major study released tuesday
the study found that if heart attack victims quickly receive clotdissolving drugs they usually dont need the extra step of the common balloon procedure known as angioplasty
some experts said the results are good news because they mean that most heart attack patients can be treated in community hospitals where angioplasty is not available
its authors estimated that if angioplasty was widely adopted after heart attacks it could raise the nations annual medical bills by  million
the study is phase  of the thrombolysis in miocardial infarction trial or timiii directed by dr eugene braunwald of brigham and womens hospital in boston
the first phase of the study showed that giving people a clotdissolving drug called tissue plasminogen activator or tpa immediately after heart attacks dramatically improved their chances of survival
the latest study presented at the annual meeting of the american heart association was intended to see whether people did better still if doctors tried to clear away any remaining blockages after giving tpa
at  hospitals across the united states doctors randomly assigned  patients to get angioplasty within two days of their heart attacks if tests showed there was any chance they might benefit
sixty percent of them actually underwent the procedure which temporarily inflates balloons in dangerously narrowed heart arteries to squeeze them open
after  days  percent of those in the angioplasty group had died or suffered further heart attacks as did  percent of those in the comparison group
dr thomas j ryan of boston university medical center commented we have the answer in this trial to a very important question of health care delivery
while small hospitals can give clotdissolving drugs to heart attack patients most of them do not have the sophisticated labs where angioplasty is performed
if the study had found that immediate angioplasty improves survival it would have meant that many more angioplasty labs would need to be established and more doctors trained to give the procedure
this ultimately makes it possible for patients to be treated in community hospitals and be transfered to terciary care centers if angioplasty is needed said dr howard morgan immediate past president of the heart association
to be effective the drugs must be given within about four hours of the start of heart attack symptoms
balloon angioplasty is also widely used to treat people with clogged heart arteries who have not suffered heart attacks
deaths from heart and blood vessel disease dropped  percent over the past decade but it remains by far the nations biggest killer taking a life every  seconds the american heart association said sunday
the good news is that we continue to see an improvement in the death rate from the biggest killer of our population said dr bernadine healy of the cleveland clinic foundation who is president of the heart association
the bad news is that heart disease is still killing almost  million americans a year and weve got a long way to go
experts attribute the decline in death rates to a combination of healthier living habits including fewer cigarettes and better food and improved medical treatment
the public ought to appreciate the progress that has been made in heart disease over the past  years said dr myron l weisfeldt of johns hopkins university
however weisfeldt who is presidentelect of the heart association also cautioned that much work remains both in improving care and encouraging people to take better care of their health
i believe we can prevent at least  percent of the ischemic heart disease in the united states by the year  if we stop smoking get cholesterol treated if its above  and identify and treat hypertension he said
association figures indicated that in   the most recent year for which there are statistics  an estimated  americans died from heart attacks strokes and other diseases of the heart and blood vessels
the associations figures show that more than one in four americans suffers some form of cardiovascular disease and almost half of those eventually die from it
studies show that about half of all heart attack victims wait more than two hours before getting to an emergency room
weisfeldt said a major health goal is getting people to go to the hospital within three or four hours of the first sign of heart attacks
during this period there is still time to give them drugs to dissolve the blood clots that are causing their heart attacks
other major goals he said include finding ways to improve the effectiveness of angioplasty a technique that uses balloons to open clogged heart arteries and finding surgical and medical techniques to identify and protect people at risk of cardiac arrest
the heart association estimates that cardiovascular disease will cost  billion this year in medical expenses and lost wages
among other statistics released by the association the most common cardiovascular disease is high blood pressure which affects  million americans
a drug that eases the hearts workload can cut the risk of new cardiac attacks and death by  percent in people recovering from heart attacks according to a major study released thursday
the study conducted in denmark found that the drug verapamil known as a calcium channel blocker was effective for the  years after a heart attack
calcium blockers are among several classes of medicines commonly prescribed to relieve high blood pressure
this is the first trial that indicates that a calcium blocker may be beneficial after an acute myocardial infarction or heart attack said dr carl j pepine of the university of florida
several other studies of calcium blockers including one large us study published last year failed to find any benefit from using the medicines after heart attacks
according to the danish study verapamil is about as effective as another variety of blood pressure medicines known as beta blockers at protecting people after heart attacks
while calcium blockers may not replace beta blockers after heart attacks the researchers said these drugs still should have a role in treatment
many patients do not tolerate beta blockers said dr kresten mellemgaard of central county hospital in hillerod denmark a coauthor of the study
this means the drugs often cannot be given to cigarette smokers who are frequent victims of heart attacks
in the study conducted at  community hospitals doctors compared  patients who got verapamil after heart attacks with  people who took placebos
after  months of followup there were  deaths or recurring heart attacks among the verapamil patients compared with  in people who got the dummy medication
we wanted to see if an effect would be observed with verapamil said dr forgen fischer hansen of copenhagen municipal hospital
if it had an effect it should be seen in the first  to  months because there is a big increase in mortality in myocardial infarction in this period he said
the researchers believe that by reducing the amount of work needed by the heart to sustain circulation calcium blockers lowered the chances of ischemia episodes in which the hearts own muscle is deprived of oxygen
they said they were unsure why earlier studies failed to show any benefit from calcium blockers after heart attacks
james h chesebro of the mayo clinic said a fiveyear study found that aspirin does not stop the continued buildup of existing blockages in the arteries feeding the heart although it may modestly protect against the development of new deposits
however like other studies this one found that aspirin signficantly cut the risk of heart attacks
eugene braunwald of harvard medical school said the next phase of a large study of clotdissolving drugs will see what effect they have in unstable angina
a natural substance called transforming growth factor beta appears to be able to limit damage to cardiac cells following a heart attack according to a study published in the journal science
in a study at the jefferson medical college in philadelphia a group of laboratory rats induced to have heart attacks suffered  percent less cell damage after injections of transforming growth factor beta than did rats that did not receive the tgf beta
tgf beta is a growth factor that opposes some of the bad guys following a heart attack said dr allan m lefer a professor at jefferson
lefer said his research team simulated heart attacks in  rats by partially blocking key arteries in their hearts
the extent of heart cell damage was determined by measuring the amount of creatine kinase in the heart tissue following an attack
hearts damaged when the blood supply is interrupted as in a heart attack tend to lose creatine kinase said lefer
lefer said the tgf beta seems to block the action of other substances such as tumor necrosis factor that can cause blood vessels to narrow following a heart attack
narrowed blood vessels carry less oxygenrich blood to cells and this causes additional injury following a heart attack
tgf beta is normally present in heart cells but the study published in science said that it is missing from rat heart cells damaged by a simulated heart attack
though tgf beta is produced naturally in the body lefer said his research team used a substance produced artificially by genentech a california biotechnology firm
lefer said his team is now conducting additional studies with tgf beta and that any experimental treatment of human heart attack victims with the substance is at least a year away
an intestinal operation to lower the cholesterol of heart attack patients reduced their risk for another heart attack or death from heart disease researchers said today
the surgery called a partial ileal bypass has one significant drawback it causes chronic diarrhea that persists for years
during an average of  years of follow up the death rate among surgery patients who had sustained minimal heart damage was  percent
dr henry buchwald of the university of minnesota who directed the study said the surgery should be considered along with cholesterollowering drugs as a possible standard treatment
it is eminently logical to extend all cholesterollowering therapy including this to patients with high cholesterol who have not had a heart attack
besides diarrhea those who undergo the surgery are somewhat more prone to have kidney stones gallstones and intestinal obstructions
the study was conducted in minneapolis los angeles philadelphia and little rock ark and published in todays new england journal of medicine
despite wide acceptance of cholesterol lowering doubts remain about whether it actually helps people live longer if they already have healthy hearts
although the latest study was conducted exclusively on people who had suffered heart attacks buchwald said he believes the research should settle that question
it offers the strongest justification for marked lipid cholesterol ineervention that has ever been offered buchwald said
in the study  people who recovered from heart attacks underwent the surgery while a comparison group of  people were treated with diet alone
the overall risk of dying from heart disease or suffering another nonfatal heart attack was reduced  percent among the surgical patients with the healthiest hearts
the surgical patients also required less than half as many coronary bypass operations because of clogged heart arteries
doctors should be cautious in prescribing aspirin as a preventer of heart attacks until more research supports its value the food and drug administration said
taking aspirin to prevent heart attacks may increase some peoples chances of dying of other things especially hemorrhagic strokes the agency said in a commentary in todays journal of the american medical association
the fda persuaded aspirin makers in march to refrain from promoting aspirin as a preventer of first heart attacks at least for now
a study published in january indicated an aspirin every other day reduced the risk of nonfatal first heart attacks  in  male doctors over five years compared with  who took a nonaspirin substitute
aspirin tends to promote bleeding by reducing the ability of blood platelets to help form clots
heart attacks usually occur when clots form in the arteries nourishing the heart and choke off its blood supply
but aspirin may increase health risks for people who already have clotting problems or for those who have high blood pressure which puts them at increased risk for hemorrhagic strokes the fda commentary said
strokes are the result of brain damage caused by bleeding in the brain or by blood clots hemorrhagic strokes are those caused by bleeding
the fda commentary pointed to  hemorrhagic strokes recorded among the  subjects taking aspirin in the recent study compared with two such strokes among  subjects taking the substitute
overall death rates for the two groups were the same though the aspirin groups nonfatal heartattack rate was much lower
physicians will for a time be forced to make their professional judgments about aspirin use on the basis of incomplete information said the fda commentary cowritten by agency director dr frank e young
we agree with them completely said dr julie buring a harvard university researcher who participated in the aspirin study
she added in a telephone interview yesterday that an extension of the study is under way and researchers expect to report to the fda in late fall
the commentary noted a british study also released in january of  male physicians that found that aspirin failed to protect against heart attacks and that it was associated with a  fold increase in disabling strokes
the experiment also hinted that the blood and urine test which measures the activity of a blood protein called renin might suggest a new risk factor for heart attacks
about half of the  million americans who suffer a heart attack each year dont have the known risk factors for heart disease such as high cholesterol levels cigarette smoking obesity and high blood pressure
the blood and urine test is already being done in many commercial laboratories but for medical conditions other than heart attack risk said john h laragh of the cardiovascular center at cornell university and new york hospital
dr laragh pioneered the research underlying use of the test which was developed by his wife biochemist jean e sealey
the blood portion of the test determines whether the kidneys are releasing renin into the blood stream and how active the chemical is
the release of renin is the first step in a rapid chemical chain reaction that raises blood pressure
the test is based on the fact that if the salt concentration in the blood rises tending to boost blood pressure the activity of the renin normally drops to offset the effect of the salt
the new experiment was designed to test a theory put forth by dr laragh and his colleagues that the activity of the renin in the blood foretells a possible heart attack
the cornell cardiologist has argued that in many people with high blood pressure the activity of the renin in the blood is much higher than is warranted by the amount of salt in the blood
on the other hand in other patients with high blood pressure the activity of the renin is much lower than is warranted by the degree of salt in the blood
in the experiment blood and urine samples were obtained at new york city offices and factories from  workers found to have mild to moderate high blood pressure
the patients high blood pressure was initially discovered in a screening program carried out by michael h alderman and his colleagues at albert einstein college of medicine who operate a worksite blood pressure control program in cooperation with local unions
in  dr laraghs group began testing the renin activity in blood and urine samples collected by dr aldermans team
the results published in this weeks new england journal of medicine lend strong support to dr laraghs theory
but the seven heart attacks in this small group constituted the highest incidence of heart attacks among the patients  heart attacks per  personyears of observation
the incidence in the high renin patients was more than double the incidence in those with a normal renin profile   heart attacks per  personyears  and more than triple that of the patients with a low renin profile  per  personyears drs
regardless of how the statisticians broke down the patients into various groups those with high renin profiles almost invariably had the highest incidence of heart attacks
smokers had more heart attacks than nonsmokers but the incidence of attacks in smokers with high renin profiles was more than six times that in smokers with low renin profiles
but the real dynamite is in the patients who didnt have any of the usual risk factors dr laragh said in an interview
among patients who had normal blood cholesterol level and were free of diabetes those with high renin profiles were seven times more likely to have a myocardial infarction heart attack than those with normal or low renin profiles the researchers wrote
there were no heart attacks among the  patients with low renin profiles who had no risk factors other than high blood pressure
to dr laragh this suggests that a high renin profile might signal a high risk of heart attack even for people without high blood pressure
in an accompanying editorial victor j dzau of stanford university medical school said the study shows that the renin profile test is potentially useful in identifying high blood pressure patients who are at risk of a heart attack
apparently by coincidence abbott laboratories announced on tuesday that is developing a high blood pressure drug that works by inhibiting the activity of renin
a bigselling class of high blood pressure drugs including bristolmyers squibb corps capoten and merck  cos vasotec are known as ace inhibitors because they work by stopping renin in the blood from being converted to a second chemical called angiotensin
studies are under way to see if these ace inhibitors protect patients against heart attacks as well as lower their blood pressure

if thats so said sen paul simon dill hes the only person gathered in the room who does not have an opinion
 two pivotal members of the member committee  howell heflin dala and arlen specter rpa  also voiced concern about thomas answers
but the panels traditional third swing vote dennis deconcini dariz said thomas was doing well
 heflin cited the appearance of a confirmation conversion and said it may raise questions of thomas integrity and temperament
 specter blamed fellow committee members more than thomas in concluding we really havent moved very far in the process
 thomas a black federal appeals judge was picked by president bush to replace the retiring thurgood marshall the high courts only black justice
 deconcini said he thought the conservative thomas handled the privacy questions very well without taking a stand on abortion
 thomas expanded earlier testimony by saying wednesday that he believed the right of marital privacy was fundamental  a status that accords it the fullest judicial protection from government intrusion
to give such an answer he said would undermine my ability to sit in an impartial way on such an important case
 thomas who sat alone at the witness table with no notes or reference materials also claimed a lack of familiarity with the subject matter when asked about some of his former speeches and articles
 that moved committee chairman joseph biden ddel to give thomas a stack of the judges past speeches so the nominee could help me understand them during future questioning
 thomas testifying calmly but warily did offer fuller comment on another hot issue before the high court prayer in public schools
 after simon discussed the feelings decades ago of a jewish elementary schoolboy who left the room each day while his classmates recited a prayer thomas said any policy of exclusion should be considered inappropriate
 outside the hearing room abortionrights advocates said thomas should not be allowed to disavow past comments they say show he would vote to ban most if not all abortions
 his most unimpressive testimony poses two equally disturbing possibilities he is either willfully misleading the committee about his views to win confirmation or he is a man whose convictions have shallow roots said arthur kropp of people for the american way
 sen patrick leahy dvt said he could not understand how thomas prior statements touching on the  abortion decision could have been made without considering its content
 although thomas appeared to back away from comments made in past speeches or articles he told the committee my view is that i have been consistent
 thomas opponents believe republicans strom thurmond of south carolina orrin hatch of utah charles grassley of iowa alan simpson of wyoming and hank brown of colorado are solid thomas backers
edward m kennedy dmass and howard metzenbaum dohio will be joined by the three swingvote senators and biden leahy simon and kohl in voting against the nominee

asked several times by sen herb kohl dwis about womens right to end their pregnancies thomas said whether or not i have a view is irrelevant
 president bush asked at a news conference whether thomas claim not to have an opinion on abortion is credible answered thats a question for the senate to decide
 committee chairman joseph biden ddel began to show signs of exasperation today during spirited questioning about the nominees views on natural law a theory that certain rights exist independent of written law
he said thomas had been asked more than  questions about his abortion views even though justice david h souter was asked only  such questions during his confirmation hearings last year
 thomas said senate confirmation of his nomination would give him an opportunity to serve and give back and to bring something different to the court
 several senators were openly skeptical wednesday over thomas insistence that he has no opinion on the  supreme court decision legalizing abortion
 if thats so said sen paul simon dill hes the only person gathered in the room who does not have an opinion
 today kohl asked the nominee is it fair of you to say to us for the most part just view me on what im saying here this week

the committee will continue to hear testimony for and against thomas at least through the end of the week but the outcome does not seem to be in doubt
several committee members said they expected the committee to recommend by a  or  vote that the senate confirm thomas
 before thomas testimony ended the unflappable yearold federal judge was criticized sometimes in harsh terms by several liberal democrats
they accused him of being evasive and of disavowing many controversial statements he made while an official of the reagan and bush administrations
 thomas repeatedly explained that he made the speeches as an advocate for administration policy acknowledging that they often contained overheated rhetoric
 sen howard metzenbaum dohio said he found it difficult to accept the notion that the moment you put on a judges robe all the views and positions which you held prior to going on the bench just magically disappear
 sen edward kennedy dmass delivered a long stinging lecture to thomas declaring the vanishing views of judge thomas have become a major issue in these hearings
 kennedy told thomas he had walked away from his record on the right to privacy refused to comment on its application to abortion and asked lawmakers to believe that an intelligent and outspoken person like yourself has never discussed roe vs wade the landmark  abortionrights ruling with another human being
 moderate republican arlen specter of pennsylvania who often casts a swing vote on the committee said he was not troubled by thomas shift toward more moderate views at the hearings
 if thomas is confirmed as expected he made it clear that for the first time in decades there would be not one justice on the supreme court who is convinced that capital punishment is unconstitutionally cruel
 justice thurgood marshall whom thomas would replace was the last member of the court who opposed the death penalty in all cases
thomas told the judiciary committee that philosophically there is nothing that would bother me personally about upholding it the death penalty in appropriate cases
 after thomas left the hearing room an american bar association evaluation committee told the senators that his articles in law journals were deficient in presentation content scholarship and analysis
 but those limitations were outweighed by his brief but highly satisfactory performance on the court of appeals the committee said noting that we found only one opinion to criticize and many to praise
a major earthquake rocked northern california tuesday evening collapsing part of the san francisco bay bridge and shaking candlestick park and buildings up to  miles away
there were reports of injuries at candlestick where fans were waiting for the world series to begin and the stadium was evacuated abctv and cable news network reported
the quake which lasted about  seconds measured  on the richter scale according to seismologists at the california institute of technology in pasadena
televised footage of the bridge showed that a foot section of the spans upper deck had collapsed onto the bottom level
players from the san francisco giants and the oakland athletics were on the field and stood around as fans began to leave their seats
the quake shook buildings in sacramento  miles to the northeast and was felt as far away as reno nev  miles to the east
the quake knocked out phones and power including electricity at the associated press bureau in san francisco
an earthquake of  on the richter scale can cause slight damage in the local area  moderate damage  considerable damage  severe damage
a  reading is a major earthquake capable of widespread heavy damage  is a great quake capable of tremendous damage
a violent earthquake rocked northern california during tuesday evenings rush hour caving in a section of the san francisco bay bridge terrifying world series fans in candlestick park and shaking buildings as far as  miles away

the major earthquake that struck the san francisco bay area tuesday occurred in a region seismologists targeted as having the highest probability of a strong quake in northern california
a  report by the us geological survey placed the probability of an earthquake of  magnitude on the richter scale at  percent by the year  in the southern santa cruz mountains
the high probability is based on several factors including length of time since the last major earthquake struck the area in  said clarence allen professor of geology and geophysics at the california institue of technology in pasadena
he noted that the  report titled probabilities of large earthquakes occurring in california on the san andreas fault presented information that was already widely known among scientists
frank baldwin of us geological surveys earthquake center said the quakes magnitude was  on the richter scale
initial reports indicated widespread damage from tuesdays quake especially affecting highways and old masonry buildings
the damage in the bay area occurred to the same kind of structures heavily damaged in the  whittier quake in the los angeles area which registered a  richter reading allen said
allen said many of the same kinds of older structures that appeared to have been damaged in san francisco also exist in the los angeles region
the highest the usgs says is in the central california town of parkfield where there is a  percent probability of a magnitude  earthquake by the year 
ever since the  earthquake devastated san francisco many scientists have believed the next big one would strike the los angeles end of the mighty san andreas fault
but studies in recent years have reminded the bay area that it also faced another seismic disaster and those studies became a reality tuesday when a quake measuring  on the richter scale rocked the bay area
a  paper in the geophysical research letters predicted a magnitude quake could happen any time on a portion of the san andreas fault that stretches  miles from palo alto southward through the santa cruz mountains and on to san juan bautista
the quake was centered on the san andreas segment described in the article but tom heaton the scientist in charge of the us geological survey office in pasadena said it wasnt clear yet whether it broke all or part of the mile segment
the  study by columbia university geology professor christopher scholz was among several that produced conflicting estimates on the likelihood and size of the quake that finally happened tuesday
these studies gave various interpretations of how much stress inside the earth was released by the great san francisco earthquake of  which had a magnitude of about  and killed at least  people
scholz pointed to evidence that the  quake didnt relieve as much stress in the santa cruz mountains as other scientists believed
that suggested a bigger quake might happen in the san francisco bay area sooner than some believed
faced with conflicting estimates the geological survey issued a july  report that it said represented a consensus on the debate
the report said the mile segment had a  percent likelihood of producing a magnitude quake within  years
it said the southernmost  miles of that segment had a  percent chance of generating a magnitude quake within  years
thus most assumed that los angeles not the bay area would fall victim to the next seismic catastrophe the  usgs report cast doubt on this assumption
federal emergency officials have estimated that the next big one  a quake like the  san francisco quake  could kill  to  people in southern california and  to  people in the bay area
private groups and officials from tokyo to london to charleston sc offered help to the ruptured san francisco bay area but some said relief for the earthquake could drain coffers already strained by previous disasters
los angeles long san franciscos west coast competitor but equally at the mercy of the san andreas fault quickly shipped doctors sonic equipment and fire investigators to the bay area

the salvation army had the food cooking almost before the earth quit shaking in northern california while the red cross opened the doors and unfolded cots in  shelters
we dont wait for anybody said col leon ferraez communications director of the salvation army
according to ferraez the organization dispatched  mobile canteens to the hardesthit earthquake areas within minutes
all salvation army centers in the bay area including  community service centers and scores of other units have been turned over to the relief effort
los angeles donated sonic equipment to help detect sounds of people trapped in rubble
and officials in los alamos nm dispatched a device used to locate survivors of last years armenian quake
israel offered the services of a special army rescue squad that also helped dig out victims in armenia
a team of british engineers were to fly to san francisco today to help assess structural damage from the quake
the bay area has a large asian population and callers from japan and the philippines and other countries jammed phone lines trying to reach relatives
the osaka japan city government announced it was sending  to san francisco a sister city since 
los angeles mayor tom bradley sent police and fire investigators to assess damage from the quake and convened his own emergency council in a special meeting to discuss other possible measures
i am joining millions of californians as we intensely watch the damage of the large san francisco earthquake said bradley
we all know the horrors of an earthquake and we express our deepfelt sympathy for the people of the san francisco bay area
an anheuserbusch inc brewery in fairfield  miles northeast of san francisco interrupted normal operations to fill cans with drinking water instead of beer for free shipment to relief agencies the company said
coast guard offices across the west coast provided san francisco with as many boats and helicopters as could be spared said coast guard spokeswoman elizabeth neely
the red cross sent  units of blood from los angeles the san diego blood bank rushed  units to san francisco within an hour of the quake more than  units were sent from portland ore giving makes them feel good said trudy sullivan a red cross spokeswoman in portland
even the internal revenue service got into the act announcing it would waive penalties for taxpayers unable to file returns or make scheduled payments because of the earthquake
president bush directed  million in immediate aid for quake victims and said he would visit the area friday or saturday
but some officials said the disaster could strain the coffers of private agencies and those of the federal emergency management agency which was criticized for its response to the stormlashed carolinas
the red cross began its fiscal year july  with  million in its disaster budget and had spent  percent by september
when a major earthquake and a major hurricane hit backtoback you can bet it will stretch red cross disaster resources and manpower said bob vessey director of disaster services in washington dc
tuesdays earthquake the strongest on the san andreas fault since the san francisco quake on april   came in a place that had been identified by scientists just last year as the most likely spot for a major jolt in northern california within the next  years
the epicenter of the temblor eight miles eastnortheast of the city of santa cruz in the santa cruz mountains was at virtually the same spot as earthquakes in the magnitude range that occurred on june   and aug  
the us geological survey in a  report on regions of high earthquake probability in california said there was a  chance of another magnitude earthquake in the immediate vicinity by the year 
the report cited even higher probabilities for major temblors on the san andreas near parkfield in central california and coachella in southern california in the same period but it pinpointed the santa cruz mountains as the most vulnerable spot in northern california in part because the area marked the southernmost point of maximum ground slippage during the  earthquake
a period of  years is short as far as earthquake intervals go and during this time scientists said tuesday night pressure was probably building up in the southern neighboring segment of the san andreas which had not slipped as much
thomas heaton the geological survey scientist in charge of the agencys pasadena field office said that the  and  earthquakes now must be seen as preshocks of the tuesdays  temblor
he said foreshocks would not be the proper term since months had elapsed before the more powerful earthquake struck
but he joined caltech scientists in saying that aftershocks as strong as  magnitude should be expected and that the pattern of aftershocks could last for months
after both the  and the  earthquakes in the santa cruz mountains the state office of emergency services and the us geological survey issued warnings of increased risk of sizable shakes ranging up to  magnitude within the next few days in the vicinity
but these warnings said that if nothing happened then the chances of a major earthquake would recede to normal for the vicinity
the trouble was the area was more prone to quakes at this time than any other place in the bay area on the san andreas fault
only the nearby hayward fault may harbor as great a danger of a catastrophic earthquake in the bay area
the san andreas the longest and bestknown earthquake fault in california extends from point arena in mendocino county to the salton sea
although tuesdays quake was powerful waverly person chief of the national earthquake information service in golden colo cautioned that at  magnitude it should be considered only a strong shock not a major one as a quake in the  to  range would be classified or a great one as a quake of  or above would be
person and others in the geological survey warned tuesday night that the probability is  that a temblor more powerful than tuesdays will strike in southern california sometime in the next three decades
but as it was tuesdays quake was about four times stronger than the devastating sylmarsan fernando earthquake of  and  times stronger than the  whittier quake
person said that like most san andreas earthquakes this was most likely to be a strikeslip quake with one side of the fault grinding horizontally past another
but he said a final evaluation would have to await onscene inspection teams that will be sent into the epicenter area today by the geological surveys menlo park office
jim dewey a research geophysicist at the national earthquake center said preliminary evaluations indicated that the fracture was about  miles deep and that the quake rupture extended about  miles south down the fault from the epicenter
person said that the area of strongest shaking was around santa cruz although this evaluation too will have to await field evaluations as will a final confirmation of the magnitude of the earthquake
the nearest metropolitan area to tuesdays earthquake san jose has seen nearly a dozen earthquakes of  magnitude or greater in the last  years but several of them have been on the calaveras fault which generally runs just east of san jose more than  miles east of san andreas at this point
scientists do not yet understand whether the quakes on the calaveras fault may have been a precursor or somehow added pressure on the san andreas
but in august  a magnitude quake struck under coyote lake east of gilroy and south of san jose and since then there have been a number of quakes
in august geological survey scientists had expressed concern at the stepup in magnitude quakes south of the bay area
meanwhile a new mexico scientist who studies tidal forces supported by two eyewitnesses said tuesday night that at a private lecture in san francisco on oct  he had stated that a strong quake in the vicinity was probable on or about oct 
iben browning of sandia park n m said he had based his prediction on an assessment of tidal forces caused by the moons relationship with the earth
he said he had decided to keep the assessment private because he feared that publicity about it would cause people to panic
  civic center area buildings damaged a story building south of market collapsed killing 
  portion of san franciscooakland bay bridge at eastern end collapsed one person reported killed
other areas of damage major damage to interchange of bayshore fwy  and state route  in san mateo

on telegraph hill jerry lubenow got his biggest shock when he arrived at his apartment after the deadly earthquake
he then talked to friends who live on nob hill and russian hill which are also situated on rock and learned that their residences also avoided damage
only a few miles away in san franciscos affluent marina district dozens of fashionable townhouses were damaged or destroyed
why did some of the luxury fourstory apartment buildings collapse at the marina while in nearby chinatown shops made of unreinforced masonry sustained little damage in the  temblor
why did highrises that form the elegant san francisco skyline escape virtually unscathed while an office building in the citys southeast district peel apart killing five pedestrians below
the buildings that collapsed did so because of a combination of two things very poor soil and very poor structural design said peter i yanev chairman of eqe engineering inc a structural engineering firm in san francisco
they were on top of the worst soil conditions in the city explained yanev who said he has traveled to all the major earthquakes in the last  years studying their impact on construction
the soil beneath the marina district where six buildings burned down or collapsed is made up of landfill partly dredged from the bay more than  years ago
yanev said many of the buildings in the neighborhood were erected in the early part of this century when there were no earthquake codes
what collapsed and killed some people were fourstory apartment buildings that had garages built all the way along the bottom floor yanev said
should we have an earthquake centered off the golden gate bridge instead of santa cruz youd probably have hundreds of these buildings collapse he said
chinatown survived relatively intact yanev said because it is located up in the hills atop very firm soil and the epicenter of the temblor was many miles away
jay cahill an owner of cahill construction co a contractor that built several highrises in the city said the earthquake codes did their job
what this quake proves is that the engineers were right when they said tall buildings could withstand a strong quake he said
they said the downtown buildings are constructed to withstand a quake of at least  magnitude with an epicenter in san francisco
an earthquake means that the ground shakes and that means force is applied to the sides of buildings said george c lee acting director of the national center for earthquake engineering research at the university of buffalo
when architects design skyscrapers lee said they factor in wind gusts and earth movement  forces that are not considered as much when constructing smaller buildings
in smaller buildings he said contractors usually make sure that vertical forces  such as snow and ice  cannot force a structure to collapse
throughout the bay area residents were left to puzzle over why the earthquake savaged some buildings and bypassed others much like san francisco was left to wonder why the marina district was hard hit and others spared
in santa cruz initial damages were estimated at  million and  of the downtown mall  the heart of the city  was severely damaged
san francisco fire officials said as many as  buildings in the marina district may have to be torn down because of structural instability caused by the earthquake
if you picture a building sitting on columns with no lateral support on those columns when you get sideways motion the buildings slide left and right

although they are a continent apart the cities of charleston sc and san francisco now share a fateful page in the ledger of time
they are the scenes of two of the centurys costliest backtoback natural disasters hurricane hugo and the bay area earthquake
there are dramatic similarities and profound differences in the ways these two cities were affected and altered in the first week after they were ravaged by two powerful forces of nature  one that angrily swept across the land from the sea and one that violently rumbled beneath the earth
from the standpoint of compassion of all the people in america we can feel the hurt that the san francisco area is going through the most charleston mayor joseph p riley jr said sunday one month after hugo hit
unlike earthquakes hurricanes can be tracked by planes and radar their paths predicted with sufficient certainty for those in harms way to secure property and to flee
still at least  deaths in the carolinas are blamed on hugo while at least  deaths have been attributed to the bay area earthquake
hugo  miles across with winds topping  mph left virtually every street and every neighborhood littered with storm debris and  of the citys buildings with some degree of damage
five days after the storm many city residents remained inconvenienced most without electricity many without safe drinking water
and a week after the hurricane charleston  which like san francisco has a tourismbased economy  was still trying to cope with mountains of broken trees and shattered roofs
it was more than  days before restaurants and other stores began to slowly reopen and twice as long for night life to begin to return
tour buses return by sunday tourists and tour buses could be seen outside hotels near fishermans wharf and at other locations favored by visitors
it took almost three weeks for businesses that cater to tourists to get back on their feet in charleston
its likely to take a lot longer for the tourists themselves to return in numbers that made it one of the citys biggest industries
citywide charleston had  buildings collapse compared to  buildings destroyed just in san franciscos marina district
water mains and gas lines weakened by the heaving earth may not break for weeks or months
we lost no major economic area like the bay bridge said greenberg who was once san franciscos undersheriff and who returned with emergency supplies to help the santa cruz police
communications broke down soon after the storm crossed the coastline about midnight and it was daybreak before the nation began to learn of the widespread damage
the hurricane knocked out all local television and radio stations and local officials for almost two days depended on a florida radio station to deliver vital information and warnings
millions were watching the pregame world series program when the earthquake struck and instantly word was out that there had been a disaster
damage estimates from hugo have ranged as high as  billion while earthquake damage estimates sunday reached the  billion mark
besides that black page in the ledger of history both san francisco and charleston also have another experience in common both have experienced frustrating delays in getting disaster relief from the federal government
greenberg who has now watched the federal government respond to two of americas worst disasters said he sees relatively few differences between how the federal emergency management agency worked in south carolina and northern california
prime minister margaret thatcher has weakened her position and kicked off the race to succeed her by saying she plans to step down after winning another term opposition leaders and political observers said
mrs thatcher told the sunday correspondent in an interview published sunday that she hoped to lead her conservative party to a fourth successive election but said it was unlikely she would try for a fifth
i think people would think it was time for someone else to carry the torch she told the newspaper
she has given the riders for the tory succession their starting orders years in advance of the actual race the newspaper said
mrs thatcher who turned  last month has never previously made it clear in public when she plans to retire as party leader
earlier this year mrs thatcher overtook liberal lord asquiths  tenure as prime minister to become britains longest continuously serving prime minister of the th century
mrs thatchers popularity is the lowest of any prime minister since opinion polls began in britain  years ago and senior colleagues have publicly admonished her to change her leadership style following the surprise resignation of her treasury chief nigel lawson
lord callaghan former labor prime minister whom mrs thatcher defeated in  said her comments had considerably weakened her position
if her party wins the next election it is expected mrs thatcher would step down before her term ends to allow her successor to choose a time to call a new election
my guess is that the tory party will want someone as leader who could take them through the next parliament callaghan said
if mrs thatcher resigns while in office her successor elected by the party automatically becomes prime minister with approval of queen elizabeth ii but convention dictates that he or she seek a mandate in a general election as soon as possible
mrs thatcher would celebrate her th birthday that year and her husband denis will be  and his age may have been a factor in her decision the newspaper said
the newspaper predicted the opposition labor party will try to promote leader neil kinnock as the occupantinwaiting of  downing st who is ready able and willing to complete a full term
in an editorial today the prothatcher daily telegraph said mrs thatcher was merely stating the obvious by indicating she would not seek a fifth term
even were she not to fight a fifth election mrs thatcher could yet enjoy seven more years in charge it said
and can it really be a cause for astonishment that mrs thatcher is unwilling to commit herself to political activity in her mids and beyond

socialist president mario soares of portugal singled out her systematic opposition to the advances of the european community
during her long mandate he said the preoccupations of social justice receded many times before purely development objectives causing a climate of discontent in british public opinion to which mrs thatcher appeared insensitive
but soares also lauded the british prime minister as a determined politician who took courageous positions on critical occasions in international life and without doubt marked an era in the contemporary history of her country
german finance minister theo waigel noted despite her critical position on some questions of european integration she accomplished a great deal for european politics
a neutral letter from socialist president francois mitterrand of france told mrs thatcher she had marked an important moment in the history of your country and that of europe
iraqi government spokesman naji alhadithi said growing opposition to her hard line against iraq over its invasion of kuwait buried mrs thatcher just as the  crisis over britains attack on the suez canal ruined former prime minister anthony eden

margaret thatcher will be seen with winston churchill as the greatest british prime minister of the last  years
even european commission president jacques delors mrs thatchers archenemy in europe spoke of his high esteem for her despite their differences
alfred dregger parliamentary leader of germanys governing christian democratic union said mrs thatcher played a major role in securing western solidarity in the historical conflict for freedom and democracy
her deep and abiding dedication to the principles of liberty and democracy served as an inspiration to oppressed peoples everywhere who knew that margaret thatcher would never waver in her belief that all men and women are entitled to live in freedom
for almost a decade margaret thatcher was regarded at the white house as americas best friend the trusted ally whose strong views reinforced the conservative tone of administration policies
among western allies she was alone at ronald reagans side in  in supporting the us bombing of libya
in the persian gulf crisis she boldly joined with george bush in sending troops to the middle east
there were many doubters around the world when reagan arrived in washington with an economic program of freemarket capitalism that seemed out of step with the times
reagan successfully fired the nations air traffic controllers dealing a devastating blow to labor
two years ago as they met for the final time before reagan left office the president said he was leaving the white house with considerable satisfaction in the knowledge that margaret thatcher will still reside at no
together they advocated a hard line toward moscow and championed military readiness  even though she was the first to recognize mikhail s gorbachev as a leader she could do business with
mrs thatcher encouraged the huge pentagon buildup that reagan nurtured under the theme of peace through strength
she was a big backer of us efforts to install mediumrange missiles in europe and always seemed cautious  perhaps reluctant  when it came to disarmament
when argentina and britain clashed militarily over the falkland islands the united states was forced to make a painful choice between two allies
bush and mrs thatcher disagreed publicly last year over her governments decision to deport vietnamese and cambodian boat people who were fleeing their countries to hong kong
the berlin wall was collapsing and it appeared as if bush found german chancellor helmut kohl more interesting than mrs thatcher
she was merely one in a parade of foreign dignitaries who got the prized invitation to visit bush at camp david this year
nevertheless bush said he expected the special relationship between the united states and great britain to remain on a steady keel
for awhile she and bush were seemingly alone in their suspicions of gorbachevs unilateral cutbacks in troops and arms in europe and appeared uncertain how to respond
on the persian gulf bush said he would not rule out possible military force and ordered a huge buildup of troops to make his threat credible
she said that unless saddam hussein got out of kuwait soon the west would have to use military force to dislodge him
no one suspects that britains new leadership  whoever it is  will take a soft line toward iraq
yet if the going gets tough it might have been comforting for bush to be able to hear the tough old line from thatcher
former president reagan thanked british prime minister margaret thatcher for backing him up when other allies backed down heaping praise on his political soulmate as she heads off into the sunset
margaret thatcher was a completely reliable ally and partner of the greatest personal integrity reagan said in a statement after mrs thatcher announced her impending retirement
i could always count on her wise counsel her firm support and her loyal friendship reagan said
mrs thatcher on thursday succumbed to the challenge mounted by michael heseltine who resigned as her defense minister in 
reagan and the prime minister dubbed the iron lady formed a formidable duo in the s and made no secret of their mutual regard
two years ago as they met for the final time before reagan left office the president said he was leaving the white house with considerable satisfaction in the knowledge that margaret thatcher will still reside at no
reagan who spent thanksgiving with friends at his belair home called her resignation in the face of strong opposition a selfless and courageous decision in what she believes is the best interests of her country
the former chief executive was always grateful to mrs thatchers support of his conservative approach to foreign affairs during his own eightyear tenure
in  when the us bombing of libya was criticized by world powers mrs thatcher was the only ally who supported reagan and allowed the bombers to fly from british bases
when britain fought argentina for the falkland islands the united states was forced to choose between two allies
she also encouraged reagans nurturing of the huge pentagon buildup and backed us efforts to install mediumrange missiles in europe despite opposition from nato allies
both leaders adopted a hard line toward the soviet union but were quick to warm up to soviet president mikhail s gorbachev as the cold war thawed
reagan credited mrs thatchers resoluteness for playing a key role in ending the tensions between the western democracies and the eastern block
while the united states became mired in debt in the era of reaganomics the british economy thrived on mrs thatchers radical policies during her nearly year rule
like reagan however mrs thatcher was accused by liberals of widening the gap between the rich and poor in her country and both clashed with organized labor
margaret thatcher set the example of what a woman could achieve in british society but her critics say she did little else to help women along
one woman wrote to the independent newspaper last week that her yearold daughter wondered what title mrs thatchers successor would hold since he couldnt be called prime minister thats a girls name
emma nicholson a conservative party lawmaker said it was once unthinkable that a woman would ever be a british prime minister
mrs thatcher who trained as a chemist before studying law said she viewed herself as prime minister not as a woman
mrs thatcher who stepped down on thursday urged women to get involved in politics but did little to pull them up the ladder
several female lawmakers were appointed to junior executive posts in various ministries but the only woman to serve in a thatcher cabinet was baroness young leader of the house of lords from  to 
the truth is that although mrs thatcher is a woman she doesnt believe in the advancement of women clare short a labor party lawmaker said last month
edwina currie a former junior health minister said any other prime minister would have had several women in and out of the cabinet
its margarets fault that the only people standing to succeed her wear trousers mrs currie said last week
trree men are vying to succeed her as conservative party leader and thus prime minister in a vote by party lawmakers set for tuesday
traditional male attitudes remain strong in britain from the uppercrust allmale clubs of london to the topless women pictured daily in the tabloid press
the critical mass of women have entered middle management in government and business said lesley abdela a founding member of the  group
women represented  percent of the british labor force in  compared with  percent in  when mrs thatcher became prime minister
though mrs thatcher never made a priority of womens issues she did introduce some helpful legislation tax concessions for workplace nurseries independent taxation for married women and legislation to compel absent fathers to pay child benefits
but as prime minister she angered feminists by often emphasizing womens traditional roles of homemakers and caregivers
angela rumbold the conservative partys minister for womens issues contends that an enormous amount has been done for women during the thatcher years
jo hawkins of the  group which is seeking equal numbers of women in the house of commons believes mrs thatchers extraordinary abilities made it difficult for her to understand the needs of the average woman
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev and prime minister margaret thatcher today argued passionately during a fourhour meeting that covered subjects ranging from disarmament to reports of soviet bomber sales to libya officials said
reopening a european peace offensive that was disrupted by the armenian earthquake gorbachev had extremely frank exchanges animated warm passionate and solemn said a thatcher spokesman requesting anonymity
gorbachev also hit the streets of london stopping his motorcade to shake hands with about  people in a crowd of several hundred who cheered him outside westminster abbey
the thatcher spokesman said the soviet leader and the staunchly anticommunist prime minister love arguing
emerging from her  downing st residence into the icy rain with gorbachev at her side thatcher told reporters the talks have been very deep very wide ranging and very friendly and as always we got to grips with the real issues
the spokesman said thatcher asked gorbachev about a report from washington that moscow sold up to  longrange fighterbombers to libya which britain accuses of sponsoring terrorism
although the two leaders could make no progress on the bomber issue the spokesman said the soviet and british foreign ministers meeting separately would most likely discuss the matter at length
flamboyant former defense minister michael heseltines challenge to prime minister margaret thatcher for leadership of the conservative party has caused a political sensation in britain
a crucial first vote of tory members of parliament mps is scheduled for today and if heseltine should wrest control of the party from thatcher  the longestserving british head of government in modern times  she would also have to give up the prime ministers job that she has held since 
heres a sampling of editorial comment on the contest that has stirred britain the thatcher era in british politics is almost over
but as a political force she is condemned at best to an unrelenting rearguard action which will end sometime in a humiliating abyss
the party may sullenly support her now but they will ask the question again in the spring knowing that if they do not do so the country will ask the same question even more pitilessly when the general election comes
it is to acknowledge that an era has passed and preserve its achievements by standing down releasing her lieutenants and urging her party in the interests of a vanished unity to support mr foreign minister douglas hurd
but the task of the conservative party in the year and more that remains before the next general election must be to rally to enable mrs thatcher to rebuild her personal position and give her the confidence and support to win the fourth term she deserves
 daily mail british conservative mps must be prepared to reject mrs thatcher when they vote in the partys leadership election
it is no longer in the interests of the united kingdom which are now inextricably linked with the development of a strong and united europe for her to remain in office
apart from her domestic achievements in reviving the british economy in the s mrs thatcher has contributed much more to the development of the european community than she is often given credit for
but the european believes that her nightmare vision of europe of illintentioned people trying to destroy democracy is not shared by most of the british people
either it will reelect mrs thatcher and see the united kingdom slip into isolation as it is left behind the rest of the community
 the european a prime minister in total command for  years could not be unseated and cherished policies abandoned without an explosion within the party
 the sun mrs thatcher deserves better than to be dismissed in the shoddy and demeaning manner some tory mps are minded to have in store for her
to be brought down by a vote of censure in the house of commons as was neville chamberlain in   even that was a constitutionally respectable form of political demise
but what they are proposing to do to mrs thatcher unquestionably the greatest peacetime prime minister of this century is quite simply unworthy
persons of quality were always accorded the dignity of execution by ax or firing squad rather than the humiliation of hanging
these plotters would like to dispatch mrs thatcher who almost singlehandedly has won three elections by the political equivalent of the rope
 the sunday telegraph this newspaper has long maintained that the best result in the next general election would be for margaret thatcher to lead the tories to a fourth victory
for reasons that are probably unfair and undeserved mrs thatcher is now a victim of that strongest public mood of all time for a change
mrs thatcher is right to feel bitter that a prime minister with her track record and prestige can be so easily challenged
if she goes the manner of her ousting will leave much to be desired no other party could so lightly dispose of its leader in government this side of an election largely for reasons of unpopularity
but the tories have a nose for survival in power unmatched by any other party in the democratic world and politics is an unforgiving business
embattled margaret thatcher remains leader of britains conservative party and so the countrys prime minister  but only barely
she has survived a vote of confidence taken by her party colleagues in the house of commons winning  votes against  for former defense minister michael heseltine
but under tory party rules that margin representing something less than a ringing endorsement forces thatcher to face a second round of voting on tuesday
other candidates could choose to stand against her perhaps diluting the opposition vote and letting her claim the simple majority she needs to stay as party head
polls show the tories would do better in the next national elections with someone other than thatcher leading them
she led her party to victory in three elections steered it through the war with argentina to reclaim the falklands faced down the miners union in a long strike moved  often drastically  to reverse britains economic decline and won a prominent place on the world stage
memory and feelings being what they are it is the mistakes and irritations of this long tenure that are more likely to be immediately recalled while its achievements are left to history to salute
thatcher is seen as having become increasingly autocratic at home and a somewhat tiresome scold within the european community
her government is deeply identified with high interest rates inflation and a flat tax on every adult in place of the property tax that is generally regarded as hugely unfair
ultimately in the cold calculus of politics the question that will most decisively sway conservative mps is whether they are more likely to win the next election with thatcher at their head or someone else
president bush lost an irreplaceable pin supporting his mission in the persian gulf on thanksgiving day
he heard the news of margaret thatchers resignation as he celebrated the holiday in the saudi desert  and it clearly came as a shock
thatcher had told the world that she would fight to a second ballot after her narrow failure to retain the premiership outright on tuesday
thatchers friends all over the world had reckoned without the british conservative party which had looked at the opinion polls the bad economic news and an unpopular new tax and smelled a loss at the next election
they had reckoned without the hatred for the flamboyant michael heseltine among the middleranking party figures who risked losing their jobs and future prospects if the unpredictable tarzan came to power
it was an extraordinary scene in the palace of westminster on wednesday night as one by one her own cabinet members trooped sheepishly into thatchers office and told her in their chosen code that they couldnt support her over the weekend in the second round of secret balloting on the partys leadership
thus did the toughest fighter for shared british and american values since winston churchill become the first prime minister to be forced out of office by the conservative party since the failed war leader neville chamberlain
he had heard her doubts over the pace of german reunification and the integration of europe and had been persuaded by his advisers that she stood against the united states best interests
it was her assessment of the threat to international security posed by iraqi aggression that according to british and american sources set the moral framework for operation desert shield
the pivotal moment was when she fielded press questions about iraq on bushs behalf in the colorado mountain garden of the us ambassador to britain henry catto that marked the public turning point
douglas hurd the urbane foreign secretary is an english james baker the president already has a james baker
john major the chancellor of the exchequer and thatchers own choice to succeed her may have views very close to bushs
but he is mildmannered slightly clumsy and although widely liked and admired by his friends is almost wholly without international experience
they were the ones who would each ditch their closest friends in order to support the other reagan when overruling jeane kirkpatricks objections to the falklands campaign and thatcher when blocking her own right wings protests at the us bombing of libya from british bases
they shared the conviction that communism could be rolled back  and she helped persuade him that mikhail gorbachev was a man who could be trusted
the powerful enunciation of that belief  and its eventual vindication  may be the last great achievement of the special postwar angloamerican alliance
george bush and margaret thatcher had something more simple in common a pragmatic relationship of mutual respect and support that benefited both
but as time goes by britains allies will find that many certainties have passed along with margaret thatcher
if seductive deals emerge to save the face and the atomicweapon factories of saddam hussein her steadfastness will be sorely missed
and if europe becomes more inwardlooking and protectionist blame those who booted out the prime minister whose final words to her cabinet were its a funny old world
queen elizabeth ii awarded former prime minister margaret thatcher the coveted order of merit on friday and made her husband a baronet which is a hereditary knighthood
from now on denis thatcher will be formally addressed as sir denis and his wife as lady thatcher although she insisted friday she wished to be known simply as mrs
i have done pretty well out of being mrs thatcher said the former prime minister who resigned nov  during a fight for the leadership of the conservative party
palace insiders said friday that one reason for the quick award of the order of merit restricted to only  eminent men and women was the queens desire to demonstrate that there is no animosity between britains two most prominent women
in the past buckingham palace sources and journalists assigned to the royal court have said that the two did not get along
this puts to rest rumors that the queen and mrs thatcher didnt like each other said harold brooksbaker director of burkes peerage and an authority on the royal family
as a member of the order of merit created in  thatcher joins such luminaries in the world of arts science and politics as philosopher isiah berlin historian veronica wedgwood writer graham greene violinist yehudi menuhin and artist sidney noland as well as honorary member mother teresa
deceased recipients include prime minister winston churchill gen dwight d eisenhower missionary albert schweitzer and actor lawrence olivier
contrary to some reports the om as it is popularly called does not precede all other british royal honors but ranks behind the order of the garter which dates from 
 downing street invented by the satirical magazine private eye about life as the prime ministers consort
sir denis title passes upon his death to his son mark who is married to an american and will eventually pass to mark thatchers son michael
with an om thatcher can continue to serve in the house of commons as the member from the north london constituency of finchley
burkes brooksbaker believes that thatcher eventually should be made a hereditary countess which in britain is the female equivalent of an earl
traditionally retiring prime ministers of britain were granted earldoms although churchill for one refused a peerage preferring to remain in the house of commons
two dogs to be specific the citys top police dog and the nations top show dog
the dog fanciers club organized the event wednesday to honor champion great elms prince charming ii a fluffy little pomeranian and nero a big amiable bruiser of a german shepherd
nero was kept on his long leather leash while prince emerged from his elegant padded carrying case only long enough to pose for photographers
the pomeranian was named best in show at the prestigious westminister kennel club show in madison square garden last month
prince long used to being coddled and primped seemed oblivious to all the attention until nero grew bold enough to prod him on the chin
but neither nero nor prince got any lunch from the luncheon at sardis a prominent midtown manhattan restaurant
taking a break from the headaches of the palestinian uprising and israels election campaign thousands of israelis turned out saturday for a canine beauty pageant
marco a feisty boxer owned by dov amir padded off with the champions trophy after beating out  other pretty pooches in israels dogoftheyear contest held in tel avivs exhibition center
we can find time for other things besides the intefadeh said organizer avi marshak using the arabic word for uprising to describe the monthold wave of palestinian violence aimed at ending israels occupation of the west bank and gaza strip
israeli couples in cutoff jeans and shortsleeved shirts pushed baby strollers from ring to ring to view the more than  different breeds ranging from tiny lap dogs like the yorkshire terriers to great danes and st bernards
marshak said the contest was sanctioned by the world kennel club based in brussels belgium and had judges from the netherlands south africa italy and britain
this was in contrast to  before the uprising began when a world dog show competition attracted scores of foreign competitors to israel
even so we dont feel the intefadeh here said rafi shahaf a veterinarian who was interviewed in the show ring where conan his steel gray mastino napoletano had just taken a blue ribbon
experts say the razortight race between the rightwing likud party and the leftleaning labor party could determine the future of the israelioccupied palestinian lands

mcfadden and his wife taffe run their dog handling business in campbell and do it primarily for the enjoyment and satisfaction it brings
before a show we sometimes work around the clock brushing and cleaning the dogs working on their coats said mcfadden
 mcfadden said he handles an average of  to  dogs at each show and works around  shows a year all over the us
 over the last seven years mcfadden and his wife have shown dogs representing approximately  percent of the  breeds of dog

 but i dont want to be known as a dog zombie said wegman who did go to the westminster kennel club dog show without the dogs
 man and dog their home is one floor of a former orthodox synagogue on the lower east side of manhattan
during a recent visit it was possible to see how the artist gets two eventempered relaxed normal dogs to slip into florid housedresses or scratch each others backs
 id never heard of weimaraners said the artist who was born  years ago in longmeadow mass
his life with weimaraners began in  the year he bought a new video camera and man ray a puppy that cost 
i could do him as a dog a man a sculpture a character a bat a frog an elephant an airedale a dinosaur a poodle
 a dogs life had he been a different breed he would have been a character actor wegman said like lassie
 when man ray who had become world famous died of cancer in  at the age of  years and  months the artist mourned
i dreamed that he came back to life said wegman who spent three years living without a dog
in  he got fay ray who is now a familiar face not only among artists but among children who watch sesame street

one of the dogs three owners thinks the kennelclub world has seen enough of cory who is four years old
in what is fast becoming a pitbull match the one owner anthony attalla is suing the other two john and rita remondi charging that they have been showing cory even though he is officially retired as announced in dog news
in the suit filed in federal district court in manhattan mr attalla says cory has achieved the pinnacle of success 
in the suit he says that under the owners agreement he lays out fees and other expenses for showing the animal and he decides when to show  or to retire  cory
in a memo filed in court mr remondi claims that mr attalla retired the dog simply and solely to better the chances that mr attallas agent would win with a rival rover
the remondis also say mr attalla has bought a rottweiler to show in another category and doesnt want to spend money on both cory and the other dog
the remondis argue that the retirement fraudulently deprives them of their opportunity to show cory a dog who they assert is in the best condition of his life
former east german leader erich honecker may be moved to a monastery to protect him from a possible lynching by enraged citizens a newspaper said wednesday
in a frontpage story the masscirculation bild newspaper said lynch danger  church wants to grant honecker asylum
since honecker was ousted oct  the former communist party leader and other party officials have come under investigation for charges of corruption and living in luxury at the cost of the state
in december seven former politburo members were arrested and honecker was placed under house arrest in the government housing area of wandlitz outside east berlin
the wandlitz homes including the one in which honecker still lives are being converted to a medical rehabilitation center for children
bild said it had information that lutheran and catholic church sources have offered honecker  who is threated by public rage  protection and refuge
this is the only possibility to protect erich honecker from the rage of the east german people bild quoted the source as saying
it was the churches that became the venues for gathering of prodemocracy groups that eventually brought the overthrow of his year leadership
in recent weeks east german groups have called for punishing honecker and for moving him to smaller quarters with an outside toilet bild said
the current leadership fears that in such a situation honecker might be attacked and become a victim of lynch justice bild said
honecker  underwent gallbladder surgery in august and east german media reported he remains seriously ill sources say the ailing exleader may be placed in a churchoperated home for the elderly or even in a monastery bild reported
as protests gathered strength last fall east germanys longtime orthodox leader erich honecker lost touch with reality according to the man who succeeded him as communist leader only to be ousted later
egon krenz the successor and former politburo member guenter schabowski on wednesday gave their versions of the bunker mentality that engulfed the hardliners toward the end
there was the notion in the former party leadership that everything outside of planned events and demonstrations staged by the communist youth group was an action organized by enemy forces krenz told an investigating commission in east berlin
schabowski said honecker had personally ordered police attacks against demonstrators in early october working closely with his thensecret police chief erich mielke
all decisions and orders that led to the police actions against demonstrators and to their arrrest went exclusively through honecker and mielke
the attempts at suppression were engineered by honecker and mielke bypassing the other  members of the ruling politburo krenz insisted
thengeneral secretary erich honecker and the internal security chief erich mielke immediately after each session of the politburo consulted with each other on the security situation of the german democratic republic krenz said
the east berlin city government commission is probing possible criminal charges stemming from police brutality during the october attacks in the capital
clubswinging riot police brutally beat demonstrators on oct  and  when soviet president mikhail s gorbachev was in town to commemorate the countrys th anniversary
krenz who had responsibility for many internal security functions before honeckers ouster criticized the use of force during his testimony wednesday
the excessive action of law enforcement authorities was neither politically nor morally justifiable he told the panel speaking confidently and wearing a gray suit
krenz who was thrown out six weeks after succeeding honecker on oct  insisted he knew nothing about any orders to shoot demonstrators
krenz said he accepted joint responsibility for misjudging dissident citizens and dissident groups for years
from todays viewpoint it is incomprehensible that there was no general politburo discussion about the negative developments then taking place in society said krenz an influential politburo member even before honeckers fall
krenz added that he and other thenmembers of the politburo failed to realize that the roman catholic and lutheran churches were not working against but rather for the german democratic republic
honecker had lost touch with reality and had unrealistic perspectives krenz said of his onetime patron who for years treated him like a son
ousted east german leader erich honecker who is expected to be indicted for high treason was arrested monday morning upon release from a hospital and taken to prison the official news agency adn said
the news agency said the yearold honecker was arrested after being released from east berlins charite hospital where he had undergone surgery for a malignant kidney tumor
earlier this month east german prosecutors said honecker and former state security chief erich mielke would be charged with treason and corruption charges for misuse of their positions and state funds
honecker the aging hardline stalinist leader who ruled east germany for  years until his ouster on oct  had previously been declared too ill to withstand imprisonment
adn said that the director of charite urology clinic dr peter althaus repeated on monday that in his opinion honecker was still not well enough to be jailed
on sunday west germanys masscirculation bild newspaper said honecker would be arrested but that he would be held at a prison hospital because of his condition
earlier this month east germanys luthern church had offered to put honecker up in a home for the aged upon his release from the hospital
ousted east german leader erich honecker was arrested and taken to prison today and a prosecutor said he will tried for high treason in march
honecker  was detained after his release from east berlins charite hospital where he had undergone surgery for a malignant kidney tumor the official adn news agency said
chief prosecutor hansjuergen joseph told parliament that honecker and former politburo members erich mielke guenter mittag and joachim herrmann would be tried by the supreme court on treason charges in march
mielke was honeckers security chief mittag oversaw the economy and herrmann headed the partys propaganda department
honeckers lawyer wolfgang vogel asked the chief prosecutor to free the former leader from rummelburg prison based on a doctors statement that he is too ill to stay in jail adn said
one of honeckers doctors horst vogler said the former leader was very depressed and his mental state impaired following two major surgical operations since august
west german television showed an impassive honecker being led out of the hospital by his wife margot in predawn darkness
honeckers daughter soninlaw and youngest grandchild also came to see him off at the hospital adn quoted vogler as saying
the conviction used to carry the death penalty but that was abolished in reforms that followed honeckers ouster oct 
honecker the aging hardline stalinist leader who ruled east germany for  years had previously been declared too ill to withstand imprisonment
adn said the director of charite urology clinic dr peter althaus repeated today that in his opinion honecker is still not well enough to be jailed
on sunday west germanys masscirculation bild newspaper said honecker would be arrested but that he would be held at a prison hospital because of his condition
earlier this month east germanys luthern church had offered to put honecker up in a home for the aged upon his release from the hospital
east germanys deposed communist leader erich honecker is too sick to be held in jail but is fit enough to be tried the official news agency adn reported monday
adn quoting a health ministry statement said honecker was still recovering from surgery for kidney cancer in january and was not well enough to be incarcerated
but a medical exam by a team of doctors found him in condition to be questioned and to stand trial adn said
honecker  ruled east germany for  years until he was ousted in october as a wave of prodemocracy demonstrations swept the country leading to the peaceful overthrow of the communist government and the opening of the berlin wall
the medical panel concluded that seven other former communist officials who had been among honeckers closest aides were all fit to prosecute and to be placed in custody adn said
it said former secret police chief erich mielke former economics czar guenter mittag and former labor chief harry tisch were under arrest while the other four remained free
adn quoted federal prosecutor guenter seidel as saying he intended to continue his investigation against the former east german leaders although their poor health often disrupted the proceedings
east germany authorities on friday interrogated former communist leader erich honecker about his role in the killings of people who tried to flee the country
honecker and erich mielke head of east germanys oncefeared secret police agency were interrogated by federal prosecutors said peter przybylski a justice ministry spokesman
more than  people were shot to death or killed by land mines as they tried to escape from east germanys communist rule
the government announced in june that honecker mielke and several border guards would be investigated on possible murder charges in connection with those deaths
honecker  and in failing health and several other members of his ousted regime already have been charged with corruption and abuse of power
the murder charge could put honecker behind bars for life but his poor health makes prosecution questionable
last month a medical panel ruled that honecker was too ill to be jailed pending investigation but fit enough to be prosecuted
east germanys democratic government has changed its mind several times on whether to pursue charges against the aging members of the former hardline regime that was toppled in last autumns prodemocracy protests
ousted east german leader erich honecker will not stand trial in east germany as long as the formerly communist country exists a west german newspaper reported
the hamburgbased bild am sonntag said saturday that it would report in its sunday editions that honecker could be prosecuted in a united germany however for violation of property laws
bild quoted guenter seidel an east german prosecutor as saying that honecker had used  million for stocking a private housing estate for leaders of the former communist government
however seidel said that the investigation was not far enough along to determine whether charges could be filed against honecker before east germany merges with west germany on oct 
honecker  was ousted as east germanys leader on oct  paving the way for the countrys first freely elected government in march
honecker is in poor health and remains confined to a soviet military hospital in beelitz outside east berlin
he is under investigation on allegations of abuse of power corruption harboring terrorists and issuing shoottokill orders to prevent east germans from escaping to west germany when he served as the countrys leader
bild said that erich mielke the exhead of east germanys former secret police was also unlikely to go to court in east germany
east germanys ousted secret police chief threatened to break former communist leader erich honeckers neck when the two faced each other in jail a west german newspaper reported wednesday
yearold former security chief erich mielke shouted at honecker according to bild newspaper
mielke for years headed the dreaded secret police known as stasi which built up files on  million east germans and kept a tight rein on the population
after the popular revolt last fall that ousted the communist regime and opened the way to german unification mielke and other former communist leaders were jailed
he is suspected of giving sanctuary to members of west germanys leftist terrorist group the red army faction and of setting up contacts between the group and palestinian guerrillas
honecker is also the target of several criminal investigations one in west germany for obstruction of justice
bild said the imprisoned mielke also accused other former communist officials of betrayal and threatened to retaliate against them
one prison warden told bild that many of the guards had worked for mielkes stasi and that they might interpret his threat against honecker as an order to kill the former communist chief
bild said mielke and other members of honeckers ruling circle will be moved to a west berlin prison after german unification on oct 
a ranking member of chancellor helmut kohls party demanded the soviet union hand over erich honecker who is wanted by german authorities on manslaughter charges a newspaper reported on saturday
federal lawmaker johannes gerster said refusal to turn over the deposed east german leader for trial could burden bonn and moscows outstanding relations the neue osnabruecker zeitung newspaper reported
honecker has denied all charges against him including that he was personally responsible for the estimated  people who died trying to escape his repressive government
soviet officials have said honecker is staying at the hospital for humanitarian reasons and german police need permission from the soviets to gain entry
i demand that the soviet government immediately release erich honecker and extradite him to german justice officials the osnabrueck newspaper quoted gerster a member of kohls christian democrats as saying
honeckers fate is one of the first issues facing bonn and moscow since they signed several treaties designed to draw the two nations closer together
bfn berlin  erich honecker the former gdr head of state died at his house in santiago chile on sunday morning  may according to his lawyer
lawyer nicolas becker who had represented yearold honecker before the berlin court in  and early  told dpa on sunday afternoon that honecker had rejected an operation
his colleague wolfgang ziegler had said earlier that the former most powerful man in the gdr had obviously died from his liver cancer
he also said he cannot say whether margot honecker who had informed becker of her husbands death will be allowed to stay in chile
germany wants to try him for ordering the shooting of people who attempted to flee to the west during his years in power
but speculation lingers that german politicians have little real interest in trying a man who may possess embarrassing secrets
lets hope this special issue will be resolved gorbachevs spokesman andrei grachev quoted the soviet president as telling german media
 but tass quoted gorbachev as saying he did not exclude the possibility that honecker would leave russia for north korea in the next few days
 north korean and russian diplomats confirmed that talks were held tuesday about a north korean offer for honecker to travel to pyongyang the north korean capital for medical treatment
 li cher gvan a consul at the north korean embassy said a commercial north korean airliner remained at moscows sheremetyevo airport ready to fly honecker to pyongyang
but he said his country was still awaiting a positive reply from the russian government on the offer to accept honecker
 outside the chilean embassy several dozen demonstrators continued their vigil demanding humane treatment for honecker
the volcano about  miles west of the air base came to life last week after six centuries of dormancy
 gases ash and molten rock continued to pour out of the mountain today enshrouding it in thick gray clouds of ash and steam that rose  feet
 the philippine institute of vulcanology and seismology said it detected rhythmic ground movements today that indicated molten material was rising to the surface of the craters
 institute director raymundo punongbayan said mount pinatubo was in the early eruptive stage and after that we will have bigger ones
but he said geological studies showed that in the previous eruption  years ago the main flow cut across what is now the western portion of clark
 rains fell across the area sunday night and officials warned residents in the lush green lowlands west of the mountain to move to higher ground to escape mud flows
 air force spokesman lt col ron rand announced the evacuation in a  am broadcast over the us militarys far east network
an hour later the first vehicles began rolling out of clark for the usrun subic bay naval base where the  troops dependents and civilian employees will be housed until the danger passes
us marines patrolled the highways which pass through areas where communist guerrillas operate and us helicopters hovered overhead
 if its going to blow i hope it does it fast so i can go home before the cockroaches take my house said staff sgt
 in southern japan today mount unzen continued to shake and spew hot ash and rocks and heavy rain was falling on the tons of ash and rock it disgorged over the past week raising fears of deadly mudslides
 areas around the foot volcano covered by evacuation warnings were expanded to protect people against possible slides of volcanic debris that could be triggered by the rain police said
 an explosion of superheated gas ashes and rocks from the mountain one week ago claimed  lives and a larger flow over the weekend razed dozens more homes
 mount unzen and mount pinatubo belong to the ring of fire that circles the pacific where shifting plates of the earths crust push against each other triggering periodic volcanic eruptions and earthquakes
 in the philippines officials have evacuated more than  people in three provinces since mount pinatubo began erupting last week
but reporters found that some evacuees are returning to their homes each morning to tend to livestock and crops and heading back to evacuation centers at sundown
 punongbayan said he flew to the area and warned people there would be no time to escape once a major eruption begins
 there was no indication how long the americans evacuated from clark would stay at subic but they were ordered to take along important papers and food water and clothing for three days
 subic base spokesman bob coble said families at the naval installation had been asked to take in evacuees and that others would double up in bachelor officer and enlisted quarters
a huge cloud of ashladen steam rose up to  feet above the volcano today spreading ash over a sixmile radius the philippine institute of vulcanology and seismology said
 if it does erupt the deadly hot ash produced by the volcano could sweep across adjoining clark air base he said
also in peril are the  residents of angeles city where the air base is located about  miles north of manila
 even if the volcano does not erupt the threat of eruption is likely to keep the base closed for weeks at least lipman said
 scientists doubt its more than coincidence that the eruption is occurring at the same time as the mount unzen volcano in japan he said
 the five usgs scientists are among the few remaining people at clark air base which was evacuated along with thousands of filipinos living near the volcano
 the researchers along with  filipino scientists and their equipment today moved to a bunker on the east edge of the air base  miles from the volcano where they should be safe from ash avalanches
 mount pinatubo is typical of hundreds of volcanoes that make up the ring of fire on the pacific coasts of asia and the americas
these volcanoes  including mount lassen in shasta county and mount rainier and mount st helens in washington all in the cascade range  arise where one of the earths immense crust plates is slowly diving beneath another
 pinatubos last eruption  years ago is thought to have yielded at least as much molten rock  half a cubic kilometer  as mount st helens did when it erupted in 
 other recent volcanoes that erupted on the same scale were el chichon in mexico in  and nevado del ruiz in colombia in  if it does have a massive eruption pinatubos primary means of causing death and destruction would be hellish avalanches of hot ash   degrees or more flowing and billowing at up to  mph engulfing and searing all in their path
 in the worst case a really big eruption all of clark air force base could be covered with glowing ash lipman said
 such ash also would wreak havoc with the engines of planes at the air base lipman said
 planes flying through clouds of volcanic ash  indistinguishable on radar from rain clouds  run the risk of having their engines stalled by the grit
but winds of the summer monsoon weather pattern expected to begin any day would send ash directly toward the base
 the volcanos activity  measured by seismometers detecting slight earthquakes in its molten rock plumbing system  is increasing in a way that suggests a large eruption is imminent lipman said
 the scientists also are monitoring tiltmeters on the volcanos slopes to watch it swell as magma builds inside
but it would take several weeks of declining quakes and sulfur emissions before scientists would be reasonably confident that the military could return to the base
 volcanologists know of no reason the volcanos activity could be linked to the volcano in japan which is of comparable size
residents of nearby angeles panicked when a huge graygreenish mushroom cloud burst from the volcano and turned day to night
 stones as big as my head were falling down from the mountains said rolly soria  there was panic everywhere said manuel romualdo
 scientists warned of more possibly larger eruptions from the foot volcano which was dormant for six centuries until it began spewing steam in april
 seismologists said searing gas ash and molten rock raced at great speed down the mountains western and northern slopes
they said most of the debris flowed into the marella maraunot and odonnell rivers and that there had been no reports that property or homes had been damaged
 at a refugee center in olongapo  miles southwest of the volcano survivors told of the sky growing dark then of hearing a tremendous explosion followed by a rain of ash
 they said they scampered for safety with their belongings and livestock over roads slippery with ashfall many wearing cardboard boxes to protect themselves from the ash
 a photographer who circled the volcano in an airplane said an aerial gunnery range at clark was covered with ash as were mountains in the zambales range normally lush green tropical peaks
it was followed by a second explosion a few minutes later and a third smaller blast at  am the huge plume could be seen in manila  miles to the south and reporters at the scene said it blocked out the sun
 seismologists said the volcano had plenty of builtup magma and even more severe eruptions could come later
 the smoke is very thick like a dark mushroom in the sky television reporter gus abelgas said in a broadcast from botolan near the volcanos western slopes
 president corazon aquino visited refugee centers near angeles briefly before returning to manila for independence day celebrations
 the americans who fled clark with a few belongings monday moved in with sailors and their families at subic bay naval base  miles to the southwest
punongbayan said tuesday that the site was in the path of the volcanic flow from mount pinatubo during its last major eruption in  about  filipinos earlier had been evacuated from three provinces near the volcanos slopes and were housed in  makeshift evacuation centers outside the projected danger zone
 about  people in moraza a village on the western slope of the mountain were refusing to leave relief officials said
 on april  pinatubo produced a small hydrothermal explosion caused by underground water meeting hot rocks deep inside
 that same day foot mount unzen in japan erupted with an explosion of superheated gas ashes and rocks that killed  people
an eruption this morning caused an earthquake so strong it sent seismograph needles off the chart and registered  miles south in manila said jessie daligdig a government geologist
 villagers tied wet kerchiefs on their faces and used rakes shovels and pieces of wood to push the blanket of snowlike ash from roads
at times winds whipped the grit into the air forcing cars to use windshield wipers and headlights in blizzardlike conditions through the afternoon
 two people have been reported killed so far a filipino serving in the us navy who died in a traffic accident on an ashslick road and a filipino boy reported to have died after inhaling sulfuric fumes that began to seep from the volcano last weekend
 the initial explosions on mount pinatubo at  am wednesday sent a milehigh mushroom cloud of swirling ash and rock fragments into the skies over clark air base forcing the air force to evacuate hundreds of american volunteers who had stayed behind to guard it and to tend sensitive communications equipment
 most of the  americans who live and work at clark were evacuated monday when scientists said it was clear that the volcano dormant for more than six centuries was returning to life
 us officials have refused to say whether nuclear weapons are stored at clark but they denied news reports suggesting a radiation danger if weapons depots on the base were hit by molten rock
 many of the villages in the vicinity were holding independence day celebrations when heavy gray clouds first began raining ash wednesday morning
the mayor in san marcelino  miles southwest of the volcano was giving a speech to several thousand people when dark clouds suddenly blotted the sun and turned day to night
 calixto macalma jr a police intelligence officer said people panicked as it began raining sand
 philippine civil defense officials said that they had evacuated  people from villages within a mile radius of the volcano by late wednesday

 raymundo punongbayan director of the philippine institute of vulcanology and seismology said fridays blasts were part of a single eruption the largest since mount pinatubo awoke sunday from its year slumber
 a british newspaper the guardian reported thursday that the americans declared a nuclear alert at clark late wednesday and informed governments in manila and hong kong that a nuclear accident in the region was possible
 foreign secretary raul manglapus also said the eruption should have no effect on talks on the future of clark and subic where leases expire sept

exhibiting remarkable talent and expertise in four areas that most artists wish they possessed in merely one bernstein still might have remained an obscure musician without the unique theatrical flair that dominated his personal as well as professional life
with it he became a personality well known even to people who never bought a ticket to a musical performance or watched a serious television show
the dervish persona including his upstart gymnastics on the podium never lessened throughout his long life in the spotlight
and he lifted popular music to a higher plane infusing performers and listeners with his manic joy in creating tonal sound
some conductors mellow with age commented times music critic martin bernheimer when bernstein conducted the los angeles philharmonic at ucla in 
but bernstein at  remains a frenetic combination of orbiting rocket aerobics master superjuggler matinee idol booming cannon hysterical mime heartrending tragedian bouncing ball sky writer riveting machine mawkish sentimentalist and danseur ignoble
describing the conductor in the same concert bernheimer referred to him as the shrugging jumping sighing soaring gushing crouching rocking rolling bounding bobbing leaping jiggling stabbing hunching bumping grinding and grunting maestro in excelsis

when bernstein was  a divorcing aunt stored her old upright piano with his parents and the boy who used to play at the windowsill became fascinated with it

invited to a dance recital in new york bernstein sat in the balcony next to a man he did not recognize
invited afterward to a postrecital birthday party for copland bernstein commandeered the piano and played coplands piano variations
copland introduced bernstein to several composers and got him his first job  transcribing music for the publisher boosey and hawkes
ironically copland subsequently urged the torn bernstein to make conducting rather than composing or even piano playing his career
conducting emerged as a possibility to bernstein that same year   his sophomore year at harvard  when he met the greek conductor dimitri mitropoulos during the maestros visit to campus
the maestro also talked with bernstein privately in his dressing room after concerts promising to keep in touch
the influence of mitropoulos on my life on my conducting life is enormous and usually greatly underrated or not known at all bernstein wrote years later after his mentors had all died because ordinarily the two great conductors with whom i studied are the ones who receive the credit for whatever conducting prowess i have namely serge koussevitzky and fritz reiner
and watching him conduct those two weeks of rehearsals and concerts with the boston symphony laid some kind of conductorial passion and groundwork in my psyche which i wasnt even aware of until many years later
you must be a conductor mitropoulos replied urging him to study at juilliard or with reiner at curtis institute in philadelphia
during the summers he studied under koussevitzky conductor of the boston symphony at the new school koussevitzky was starting at the orchestras summer home tanglewood
he became like a surrogate father to me bernstein later said of koussevitzky his third major conducting mentor
he so revered the maestro that he was married in koussevitzkys shoes and white suit and always conducted wearing his cuff links
on his th birthday aug   bernstein was told by the koussevitzkys that he should visit artur rodzinsky newly appointed music director of the new york philharmonic at his stockbridge conn farm
i have gone through all the conductors i know of in my mind and i finally asked god whom i shall take and god said take bernstein  he said granting the position as a favor not to god but to koussevitzky
remarkable as his appointment was considering that he was an american and so young bernstein was given little chance of actually taking the podium
on nov  less than three months after bernstein got the job guest conductor bruno walter fell ill and rodzinsky was snowed in at his farm

successful as a pianist composer and conductor bernstein according to joan peyser in a controversial biography consulted psychiatrists because of his internal conflict over the three pursuits
his first major composition a symphony titled jeremiah was introduced in  and his first ballet fancy free and related first musical on the town both debuted in 
he sought to be a classical composer winning plaudits for symphonies jeremiah was followed by the age of anxiety in  and kaddish in  sonatas and the operas trouble in tahiti in  and a quiet place in 
in writing music bernstein achieved greater success on broadway and even in hollywood than in lincoln center
he followed on the town with the musicals wonderful town in  the score for the film on the waterfront in  and the critically acclaimed but less popular candide in 
if i can write one real moving american opera that any american can understand and one that is notwithstanding a serious musical work i shall be a happy man bernstein said in 
when many suggested a decade later that he had achieved his dream with west side story he disagreed saying there are moments when i think so but as a sum total it fails to be an opera
but i dont love it any less he added reveling in the adulation his adaptation of the romeo and juliet conflict had produced
in teaching his fourth area of expertise bernstein taught regularly at tanglewood and won his place in academic annals with his charles eliot norton lectures on tonality at harvard in 
an assessment of bernstein must include his talent and contribution as a teacher and popularizer of music a role that has set him apart most from other performers conductor historian and bard college president leon botstein wrote in harpers in 
instinctively adept at television bernstein became a prototype for carl sagan alistair cooke and others now familiar on instructive programs on the public broadcasting system
bernsteins programs botstein said displayed his gift for analyzing and enthusing about classical music without sacrificing the integrity of the score its complexity or its simple genius
no one before or since bernstein has been so effective  artistically and commercially  in proselytizing and bringing alive serious music to a mass audience
bernstein was able to apply his innate ability for commercializing his art that had made him wealthy to the struggling new york philharmonic
he introduced free concerts in the park and put the orchestra on television widening its audience and tripling paid concert attendance
if two rings of the bernstein circus rested in popular and classical music the third was anchored in his uproarious personal life

another measure of grief came from the obituary section of the new york times which includes a section of special classified ads for public condolences at  a line
the outpouring of emotions following bernsteins death filled almost  lines  inches of small type and encompassed  separate tributes
among the contributors were conductors zubin mehta and kurt masur as well as peter martins of the new york ballet and christopher keene of the new york city opera
this is perhaps not unusual for a prominent member of the jewish community involved with philanthropic activities reported irv horowitz the new york times obituary editor

what would have been a distracting disturbance at any other time melded with the music as entirely appropriate to the mood and circumstances of the occasion

wherever lenny was was theater his every move was a stage direction he said as many in the audience laughed knowingly
another west side story collaborator directorchoreographer jerome robbins had earned a laugh before he even spoke thanks to laurents introductory words fearless as lenny was there were two figures he did fear  god and jerome robbins
after noting that he wished he were young enough to pay homage to bernstein by performing the sailors variation he created in the ballet fancy free robbins  recalled that halcyon  collaboration between the two yearolds

jurors who have reached verdicts on  counts in the mcmartin preschool molestation case said wednesday they are deadlocked on the remaining  charges in the nations longest costliest criminal trial
superior court judge william pounders received a note from the jurors as they ended their days deliberation and called a hearing for thursday to discuss the deadlock and possibly opening the  sealed verdicts
in an interview wednesday evening pounders said he would deal with the deadlocked counts first either declaring a mistrial on those counts and reading the sealed verdicts or sending the jury back to resume deliberations on the undecided counts
pounders said he would discuss the matter with attorneys before quizzing jurors on whether they want to deliberate further
the jurors are deciding whether raymond buckey  and his mother peggy mcmartin buckey  are guilty or innocent of charges they molested children at their familyowned mcmartin preschool in manhattan beach
jurors asked twice for an explanation of how they could convict one defendant and acquit the other on that joint charge but seemed perplexed after they received an explanation earlier wednesday
after conferring with lawyers pounders told jurors they could convict just one of the defendants on the charge if you feel that the defendant conspired with one or more other persons
however he noted the conspiracy count includes eight alleged overt acts some of them naming only one defendant
a split verdict he said would require elimination of overt acts alleged against a defendant acquitted of the charge
among those were buckeys sister peggy ann and his grandmother virginia mcmartin who founded the prestigious but now defunct nursery school

juror brenda williams said the evidence failed to convince the jury beyond a reasonable doubt in  of the charges
even if you accept that the children were molested it didnt necessarily mean they were molested at the mcmartin preschool ms williams told reporters
raymond buckey spent nearly five years in jail without bail during the case which defense attorneys said was the result of community hysteria sparked by bizarre allegations by the alcoholic mother of one child at the preschool
some observers accused thendistrict attorney robert philibosian of using the spectacular charges to boost his failing reelection campaign against ira reiner who beat him and now runs the district attorneys office
also criticized was the decision by investigators to use a private child therapy group childrens institute international to conduct the original interviews with the children
originally there were seven defendants including raymond buckeys sister peggy ann buckey and virginia mcmartin the founder of the school mother of mrs buckey and grandmother of raymond buckey
hundreds of allegations of child molestation were filed in the case which gained worldwide attention with its tales of underground tunnels at the school and satanic rituals

jurors in the mcmartin preschool molestation case denounced the techniques of a child therapy center and a police department letter that inflamed parents and ignited the case
seven jurors who spoke with reporters in a joint news conference after acquitting raymond buckey and his mother peggy mcmartin buckey on  molestation charges thursday said they felt some children who testified may have been molested  but not at the familyrun mcmartin preschool
and they said some children may have merely repeated stories told them by their parents and interviewers at childrens institute international
the private child therapy center which specializes in abused children videotaped interviews with children from the mcmartin school after reports of molestations surfaced
jurors saw the tapes in which interviewers used anatomically explicit puppets and leading questions to elicit descriptions of molestation from children
asked what led to acquittals juror brenda williams focused on the taped interviews from the center jurors call cii
if the cii tapes had not been entered into evidence and i had not seen them i could have believed the children a little more mrs williams said
they gave me a lot of reasonable doubt agreed juror julie peters  a supermarket meat wrapper
they never had a chance to tell their stories said juror john breese  a medical technician and grandfather of five
i tried to believe the children said juror daryl hutchins  an oil company lease operator
equal criticism was aimed at a letter sent in  by the manhattan beach police department to parents of mcmartin school children
one child said his parents told him that he was molested even before he went to cii mrs williams recalled
the panelists said they threw out entirely the most fantastic allegations including some childrens accounts of being molested in a car wash we just dismissed those said mrs williams
they said a series of medical slides shown to them lacked impact because they werent sure what they were seeing in the photos of childrens genitals
some said they were unsure whether buckey was a molester but were sure the prosecution had failed to prove its molestation allegations against him beyond a reasonable doubt

may   peggy mcmartin buckey takes the stand for the first time and strongly denies she ever sexually assaulted her students
a therapist defended her interviews of alleged victims in the mcmartin preschool molestation trial despite criticism by several jurors who said leading questions undermined the prosecutions case
the jury on thursday acquitted raymond buckey and his mother peggy mcmartin buckey of  child molestation counts and deadlocked on  other counts
therapist kee mcfarlane later defended her work with hundreds of mcmartin students and suggested that the goals of therapy are at odds with the legal standards required for a successful criminal prosecution
evidence introduced by prosecutors in what became the longest and most expensive criminal trial in us history included videotaped interviews of the alleged victims
many of the interviews were conducted at an early stage of the sexual abuse investigation by macfarlane a social worker and director of the child sexual abuse center at childrens institute international
macfarlane said thursday she still believes children from the school had been molested and that they had not fabricated their accounts of abuse
at least seven jurors who attended a news conference agreed the evidence showed children had been molested
if the cii tapes had not been entered into evidence and i had not seen them i could have believed the children a little more juror brenda williams said
but macfarlane said that the interviewing techniques were sound noting that small children must be interviewed differently than adults
macfarlane acknowledged that some procedures could have been done differently including conducting more interviews over a longer period of time
it has greatly increased the awareness about the issue of child sexual abuse and about the problems of prosecuting these cases she said
there was plenty of blame to go around at the end of the lengthy and traumatic mcmartin preschool molestation trial but no one was willing to accept it
in the nations longest and costliest trial raymond buckey and his mother peggy mcmartin buckey were acquitted thursday on  child molestation charges
the system is not going to protect children said jackie mcgauley a parent who believes her child had been molested but didnt testify in the case
robert philibosian now in private practice angrily dismissed accusations that he played up the mcmartin case in   with the news media acting as eager accomplices  to boost his public profile as he ran for district attorney
to have people who know very little about professional or prosecutorial ethics to criticize me personally that i have some political motive is totally unjustified
philibosian instead pointed the finger at the man who defeated him current district attorney ira reiner
philibosian said reiner hurt prosecutors chances by dismissing charges against five of the original seven defendants and criticizing the case in a   minutes interview
but reiner calling his dismissal of charges for lack of evidence the decision were proud of said the trial took so long because of the states ponderous criminal justice system delay tactics by defense attorneys and a mess left behind by philibosian
in interviews many jurors said they believed some of the children were molested but the prosecution never established that the defendants were responsible
even if you accept that the children were molested it didnt necessarily mean they were molested at the mcmartin preschool said juror brenda williams

alan lagunoff whose son now  testified against the buckeys stood in front of the rundown longclosed nursery school and talked about his disappointment

ray buckey and his mother peggy mcmartin buckey were found not guilty thursday of molesting children at the familyrun mcmartin preschool in manhattan beach a verdict which brought to a close the longest and costliest criminal trial in history
an eightman fourwoman jury   of the members parents themselves  acquitted the buckeys of  counts of molestation after deliberating for nine weeks over evidence that had been presented over the course of more than two years
ray buckey  left the courtroom without comment  free on his own recognizance until a decision is reached on whether the district attorney will retry him on the  undecided counts
most jurors said later that they believed the children who testified had been molested but that the prosecution had failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the buckeys were culpable
the buckeys who spent years in jail as the case progressed through the judicial system had sat silently staring straight ahead as the jury filed into the room shortly before  am and the gallery of reporters and spectators grew quiet in anticipation
all the verdicts are the same said los angeles superior court judge william pounders handing them to his court clerk
clerk stan ferrell listed the counts numerically and then reading from the verdict form delivered in a single almost anticlimactic sentence the historic trials close we the jury in the above entitled actions find the defendants not guilty
i knew god would set my son and me free because we have done nothing she said as she was driven away
i held his hand buckeys mother said after the verdicts were announced and i told him i told you ray and he felt like he wanted to cry but he didnt
the acquittals concluded the longest criminal trial in history a case that stemmed from a  yearolds report to his mother six years ago that he had been sodomized at his school by a mr
the case ultimately cost taxpayers more than  million altered scores of lives and careers and provided a national focal point for the issue of child abuse
judge pounders said he was not surprised by the verdicts i found it difficult to determine how they would view the evidence in the first place
i thought that based on the evidence that was presented the jury could do almost anything and still find rational support for it
it is very difficult to test the credibility of children and when you go beyond that the natural tendency for adults is to look for corroboration
asked if the case was worth its cost in money lives and stress pounders said he thinks society benefited from the case
people will be much more alert to the possibility of this type of offense taking place at preschool and at schools pounders said
in the crowded courthouse hallways parents of alleged victims lashed out at the prosecutors for bungling the case and insisted that their children had not been well served by the judicial system
the system doesnt allow us to protect kids said the father of two alleged victims
in particular they cited the prosecutions reliance on videotapes of controversial pretrial interviews of the young witnesses at a los angeles childabuse center
they also criticized the manhattan beach police departments decision early in the investigation to send out form letters to parents announcing an investigation had begun and soliciting information
the children said juror john breese  a biomedical technician were never allowed to say in their own words what happened to them
said jury foreman luis chang an electrical engineer the key evidence that swayed me was the interview tapes
all said they had entered the jury deliberation room with open minds not only because the judge had so instructed but also because the disjointed testimony had left them confused
i went into the jury room as confused and uncertain as i was the day i first sat in the jury box the first day of this trial said brenda williams  a pacific bell service representative
i felt i had missed out on something maybe i had dozed off during some important testimony and i was hoping some of my fellow jurors had something in their notes that i didnt have in mine that would make it all come together
atty lael rubin who prosecuted the case said a decision has not been made about whether to pursue the  counts involved in a mistrial
we ultimately must respect the jurys decision rubin said even though i personally disagree with it
ira reiner blamed the criminal justice system for the length of the trial and said he backs two state courtreform initiatives
i feel great gits said indicating he had found hope that the decision would go the defense way last week when the jury informed the judge it was reaching deadlock on a conspiracy count
with the acquittal pounders freed more than  million worth of property that had been posted by buckey supporters as bail last year so that he could be released after five years in jail
buckeys mother had been free on a smaller bail amount earlier after spending nearly two years in jail
the mcmartin case  which included allegations not only of rape sodomy oral copulation and other sex crimes but also of pornographic photography sessions naked games field trips away from the school for illicit purposes animal mutilation threats and sataniclike ritual and sacrifice  began in the fall of 
the mother of a  yearold complained to manhattan beach police that her son had been sodomized by mr ray and subsequent physical examinations indicated he had been sexually abused
buckey was arrested in september of that year but was released as the investigation continued and widened to include six other teachers at the manhattan beach nursery school among them his grandmother dozens of uncharged suspects and eight other south bay nursery schools
the manhattan beach police department sent a form letter to hundreds of mcmartin school parents asking for information and a wave of hysteria swept through the affluent beach town
many parents took their youngsters to childrens institute international a los angeles childabuse diagnostic and treatment center for evaluation the majority were told that their children had been victimized
in march  ray buckey was rearrested along with his sister peggy ann buckey his mother peggy mcmartin buckey his grandmother virginia mcmartin and teachers betty raidor babette spitler and mary ann jackson
a county grand jury had indicted them on  counts that indictment was superseded in may by a criminal complaint charging them with  counts involving  children
childrens institute international deluged with concerned parents enlisted untrained therapists to assess the children resulting in videotaped interviews filled with leading and suggestive questions that would later prove embarrassing to the prosecution and provide the defense with grounds for claiming that the alleged victims had been programmed to believe that they had been molested
hundreds of south bay children had fallen victim to a nationwide conspiracy and pornography ring it was alleged and an angry mob spraypainted ray must die on the walls of the nursery school and began digging up an adjacent vacant lot in search of animal remains
the month preliminary hearing which began in the fall of  was marked by frequent shouting matches between three prosecutors nine defense attorneys and municipal judge aviva bobb and lengthy questioning of child witnesses that lasted in one instance for  days
los angeles was riveted by the daily images of youngsters clambering atop a booster chair in their sunday best to face their alleged molesters
perhaps the most poignant moment came when an yearold girl told in a wispy voice of having been raped photographed tied up and placed in a dark closet by her teachers five years earlier
in the end bobb ordered all seven defendants to stand trial on  charges telling each the court believes there is sufficient cause to believe you are guilty
one child was allowed to testify by closedcircuit television under a new state law passed especially for the mcmartin case
but a week later in january  the new district attorney ira reiner who had inherited the case from philibosian dropped charges against five of the seven defendants citing incredibly weak evidence and deciding to proceed only against ray buckey and his mother
eventually nine of  named victims took the witness stand all sticking to their earlier accounts but for minor inconsistencies
toddlers at the time of their alleged abuse and now nearing adolescence they described in graphic detail the abuses they say they suffered at the hands of the buckeys
and fellow teachers including former defendants testified that no improprieties in the small school could have occurred without their knowledge
the prosecution sought to show that the children repeatedly had been abused sexually but silenced for years by threats and also that their childlike efforts to tell their parents that something was wrong had been ignored or misinterpreted
the defense contended that nothing untoward happened at the school but that the children were programmed by therapists to believe that something bad had happened to them
the yearlong case was marked by twists and turns and tragedies prompting the judge to comment that it had poisoned everyone it had touched
day after day it was punctuated with the unexpected and bizarre  ailing family matriarch virginia mcmartin now  wrote poetry conducted colorful hallway interviews and tested the judges patience with such outbursts as this awful court
 therapist kee macfarlane who conducted many of the interviews in which children first disclosed that they had been molested came under fire when it was revealed not only that she had minimal previous experience in the field but also that she was involved romantically with the television newsman who broke the story

though the historic mcmartin preschool criminal trial finally has ended in acquittals a host of civil lawsuits generated by the manhattan beach molestation case conceivably could keep the issue alive in the courts for decades legal experts say
these include a federal civil rights suit filed friday by peggy mcmartin buckey against her accusers and others a lawsuit filed by former defendants against a television station and reporter and suits the preschool owners have filed against their liability insurance carriers
also ray buckey might file a federal suit similar to that of his mother said his attorney scott bernstein
and an attorney representing several parents of mcmartin attendees said they might now refile lawsuits against the preschool for emotional distress allegedly suffered by the children
im convinced this case will never end eli gauna who represents babette spitler a former teacher at the school said wearily
in the criminal case  the longest and costliest criminal proceeding in us history  ray buckey  and his mother peggy mcmartin buckey  were acquitted thursday of  counts of molestation involving  youngsters who attended the family nursery school in manhattan beach
the criminal case began in march  when seven mcmartin teachers were indicted by a county grand jury on  counts of molestation
defendants included buckey his mother his grandmother virginia mcmartin who was the school founder his sister peggy ann buckey and teachers spitler betty raidor and mary ann jackson
ira reiner dropped charges against the latter five defendants citing incredibly weak evidence
in  a handful of lawsuits were filed by  families seeking monetary damages against the school for medical bills cost of psychiatric therapy and emotional distress arising from the alleged molestations
but those lawsuits later were withdrawn to prevent the childrens psychiatric histories from being introduced as evidence in the criminal case
greg mooney an attorney who represented some of the plaintiffs explained that during the criminal preliminary hearing defense attorneys had sought psychiatric records of the alleged victims
defense attorneys argued that they should be entitled to the records because the children had waived their patienttherapist confidentiality by filing civil suits in which their psychiatric histories would be at issue
mooney said a decision on whether to refile will be made only after authorities decide what to do with the  remaining criminal counts
the parents could not seek damages on their own because the oneyear statute of limitations  the deadline in which a lawsuit can be filed  has passed
many of the children who attended mcmartin are now entering their early teens but the youngest of those who attended the school then is now  years old
legal experts however say some courts have held that child abuse victims can file at any time in their life
in the socalled delayeddiscovery theory a statute of limitations does not take effect until the victim actually becomes aware of molestation and some victims might suppress memories of such attacks for years
its a possibility that hangs over the former defendants said attorney gauna noting a recent landmark california court decision that set aside the statute of limitations for certain victims
mooney said he knows of families that seeking legal advantage waited for the criminal trial to end before contemplating civil action
he explained that some families believed they might have a better advantage in civil court rather than in a criminal case the burden of proof in civil litigation is the preponderance of the evidence not reasonable doubt as in a criminal trial
and some families question whether the mcmartin defendants insurance carriers would pay out to plaintiffs who successfully sued the school
but there is also sentiment among others that maybe they should pick up the civil case where the criminal case left off
they think maybe since the criminal jury couldnt get the higher standard of proof a civil jury would bring about a resolution
said one mcmartin attendees parent who asked not to be identified i might be tempted to file a civil suit to provide a trust fund for my child
the only other reasons for filing such a suit the parent added would be to work through a lot of emotional things and we have already done that by participating in the criminal proceedings
gauna spitlers attorney said the litigation will go on because maybe a halfdozen to a dozen hardline parents wont let it go away
peggy ann buckey virginia mcmartin spitler and raidor are suing the television station the reporter who broke the mcmartin story and others
a lower court held that the station kabc was protected from the action on constitutional grounds but a state appellate court ruled the case should proceed to trial and the state supreme court upheld that decision
the case now in the early pretrial stages is being watched closely because it could set precedent in the field of press law experts said
as it becomes apparent that mcmartin cases will stretch out for years to come parents and the former criminal defendants alike are trying to resign themselves to the inevitability that the matter may be one they can never leave behind
prosecutors had just dropped charges of child molestation against buckey one of the original seven defendants in the mcmartin preschool case
in that  interview peggy buckey was quite eloquent in arguing that charges against her brother ray and mother peggy mcmartin buckey should be dropped as well mann recalled friday
mann an oscar and emmywinning screenwriter and producer recognized a theme he had tapped before the hysteria of a witch hunt
soon mann became a controversial figure in the case itself  but he got the inside track on movie and book deals
and thursdays notguilty verdicts in ray and peggy mcmartin buckeys trial gave mann the happy ending he was hoping for  happy at least from his point of view
but mann and his wife myra who have an page manuscript in the works for random house and say they are close to finishing a screenplay arent expected to monopolize the telling of the yearold mcmartin case  or the perspective
at least two other books are planned and at least one prominent television movie producer besides mann says he is developing a mcmartin project
unlike the hottest truelife property of the moment  the stuart murder case in boston which has cbs and the fries co racing to produce the first docudrama  mcmartin creates some tricky legal and moral problems
none of the three networks would touch ray buckeys story predicted steven white an independent producer who used to be a movie executive for both nbc and abc
it raises so many legal and ethical questions at this point it would have to be looked at with a microscope said larry strichman a senior executive in movie development at cbs
not long after the first allegations of child molestation six years ago several producers pitched projects to networks
mann whose writing credits include the academy awardwinning judgment at nuremberg in  won an emmy for the marcusnelson murders a threehour kojak drama based on a true case in which a black youth was wrongly convicted of the killings of two white women
that and their earlier alliance with former prosecutor glenn stevens sparked charges from parents of alleged child molestation victims of a conspiracy to obstruct justice for monetary gain
stevens who said he had asked to be removed from the mcmartin trial team in october  said he and mann agreed in march  to produce a book and movie about the case with the understanding that their discussions would become public after the trial and appeals were over
outraged parents suggested the real aim was a notguilty verdict which would improve the value of manns movie deal

a hermosa beach minister who for years has tried in vain to quell rumors tying his church to the mcmartin preschool scandal announced sunday that the extreme stress of fallout from the case has forced him to seek disability retirement
john d eales of st cross episcopal church  where mcmartin pupils claimed they had been forced to take part in satanic rituals  told the congregation during his sermon that after much prayer and consultation he realized his health could not withstand the continuing harassment and vandalization the church has borne as a result of the unsubstantiated claims
the mcmartin case which prompted the longest and most expensive criminal trial in us history ended thursday with the acquittal of defendants ray buckey and peggy mcmartin buckey on a total of  counts of child molestation at the manhattan beach school
st cross was never named as a defendant in the case and neither eales nor any other official of the venerable seaside church was ever formally charged
but since  the church has struggled to shake a mcmartin pupils allegation during the preliminary hearing that six years earlier he and other students had been forced to witness animal sacrifices and satanic rituals at the altar of st cross
though investigators using sophisticated equipment checked the altar and found no trace of blood attendance dropped drastically at the church and the churchrun preschool which closed soon afterward
the allegations never died despite the passage of time and the announcement by los angeles county sheriffs investigators that they had found no evidence to support the childrens claims
periodically over the years eales said he would receive threatening phone calls at the church and rectory and the harassment increased as the mcmartin case began to wind down
in a note left in the rectory driveway after the second attack the vandals who identified themselves as the beach cities conscience warned that there is simply no place for satan worship in this town
the harassment was exacerbated by the arrest shortly after christmas of a youth counselor at the church who was charged with molesting two teenage boys he had met through his work at st cross
the counselor it turned out was a convicted child molester who had been brought into the fold about a year and a half earlier by an assistant pastor who was hired after the mcmartin case broke
then just days after that assistant pastor resigned the mcmartin verdict came down and according to several church members the anonymous phone calls returned
though at  eales has  more years until the diocese would mandate his retirement he said his doctors told him that the kind of stress you have been under kills
because of that he said he plans to extend a medical leave already scheduled to allow for some minor surgery next week and retire a year short of the year tenure that was his goal when he came to st cross
said ron russell a year member of the congregation we brought a good strong man in here and  well this has ruined him

as kostyantyn fesenko chairman of the coal industry workers trade union informed a unian correspondent viktor yushchenko the chairman of the national bank of ukraine in a telephone conversation on  june gave assurances that the money for the miners wages as well as subsidies for the following month would be found and forwarded in the next few days
workers at kghm polands copper producing combine went on strike yesterday as coal mining unions staged token stoppages in a third of the countrys pits in a major challenge to the governments economic policies
the strike at kghm in lubin western poland where mining unions representing some  workers have been demanding a  per cent wage increase came despite a management offer at the weekend to increase wages by  per cent
further increases could only come if the government eased prohibitive wage control taxes thus providing a powerful precedent for wage demands by other groups
meanwhile coal mining unions are also demanding wage increases as well as a clear restructuring strategy for their industry after last weeks scattered stoppages in some  of polands  pits wrung promises of wage rises that cash strapped managements can ill afford
in contrast to the copper industry which continues to show a profit coal mining is running at a loss with subsidies stopped in march as the government moved to control the budget deficit
the industry is experiencing a coal glut with pit head power station and export stocks amounting to some m tonnes the equivalent of a months output
polish mines produced m tonnes of coal in the first half of the year or  per cent less than in the same period last year
meanwhile kghm produced  tonnes of refined copper in the same period or  per cent more than in the first half of 
coalminers from romanias jiu valley who spearheaded violent antireform rampages through bucharest in  and  are once again out on strike pressing the government for higher wages
it has instead begun legal action to have the strike which today entered its second week declared illegal
romanians appear solidly opposed to the strike angered by the miners demands for an average wage of the equivalent of dollars  a month
the ministry of industry argues that the m tonnes of pit coal produced each year in the jiu valleys  mines is not a vital source of energy
the regions coal supplies two nearby power stations but these plants which together account for only  per cent of the countrys electricity capacity could also be run using lignite and gas
they are also following the call of their charismatic leader mr miron cosma the man who led them on protests to bucharest and secured their earlier wage increases
mr cosmas motive for calling the strike  for which surprisingly he has the support of rah the stateowned coal mining company  are less obvious
the ministries of industry and finance are conducting investigations into charges of fraud and embezzlement by mr cosma and several senior rah company officials
in response to the question as to whether he intends to lead his men who appear to support him wholeheartedly to bucharest again he says with miners anything is possible
in recent months mr cosma has claimed he has evidence that senior government officials including president ion iliescu called miners to bucharest as part of plans to consolidate their own power
most of the countrys  million coal miners are still working but output in some key regions has been halved saddling gorbachev with a substantial labor and fuel problem even as he struggles to revive the soviet economy

 the strikers are seeking wage increases of at least  percent better working conditions and earlier retirement
they claim the government has not kept promises it made to raise miners living standards as settlement of a nationwide coal strike in july  the  strike which involved more than  miners made only economic demands
they are unhappy with gorbachevs proposed union treaty which would leave the central government in control of the economy defense foreign policy and communications he said
 finally the union wants a law on property that would define what belongs to the government and allow private ownership of land and industry including some mines he said
 according to the state news agency tass the strike has spread to the donetsk coal basin of the ukraine the vorkuta and inta regions of northern russia and the kuznetsk coal basin of western siberia
the national union of mineworkers said an estimated  black gold and coal miners in south africa will begin a strike sunday night for higher wages and better working conditions in what it said would be the largest job action ever to affect the mining industry in that nation
the strike initially would cover more than half of south africas gold mines and about onefifth of its coal mines said cyril ramaphosa the unions general secretary
if workers in mines not included in current negotiations join in sympathy strikes a total of  miners could be on strike he said
the unions announcement produced little immediate reaction on south african financial markets where analysts said a strike had been expected and probably wouldnt have much impact unless it lasted more than a month
mining companies shares rose along with the price of gold but the metals rise came mainly in reaction to increased tensions in the persian gulf
mr ramaphosa said the union is demanding a  acrosstheboard wage increase for black miners who the union says earn an average of  rand  a month
the chamber of mines which represents the nations six biggest mining houses says black miners earn about twice that much
anglo american corp the huge south african mining house warned against a strike saying miners had received a good wage increase in july and wouldnt gain further raises by a job action
but at this stage it seems the strike seems inevitable said mr ramaphosa who added that there hadnt been any negotiations with management since a strike ballot received overwhelming support during the week of july 
he also warned of possible confrontations with police saying we have issued instructions to our members that if they are attacked they should defend themselves
miners strikes in recent years have featured clashes with police leaving dozens of people dead
the total mines that will be affected are  gold mines around the country and  collieries the union official said
our union is at the same time in dispute with a number of other companies where strike action could take place at any time should the various mine managements refuse to accede to our members demands
he said such other companies included de beers consolidated mines ltd the worlds largest diamond miner
in addition to the general wage increase mr ramaphosa said the union is demanding pay for black miners doing dangerous work
the black miners also are asking for  days leave each year and a paid holiday on june  the anniversary of the  soweto riots
a soviet newspaper has painted a highly sympathetic portrait of andrei d sakharov and yelena bonner countering past attacks on the dissident couple once branded as traitors by the staterun media
but the account in moscow news only indirectly mentioned the nearly seven years sakharov spent in forced internal exile for criticizing the soviet drive into afghanistan indicating that topic is still too sensitive
in its latest issue the weekly devoted its entire back page to describing the home life of sakharov  the  nobel peace prize winner and said the words most often heard in his seventhfloor moscow apartment are help me
sakharovs apartment on a major thoroughfare has been a mecca for soviets seeking his aid since he and his wife were allowed to return from exile in the closed city of gorky in december 
since then sakharov who was one of the creators of his nations hydrogen bomb has vocally supported soviet leader mikhail s gorbachevs reform campaign but has called for the liberation of all political prisoners and more improvements in the field of human rights
past soviet reports published before gorbachev became soviet leader accused bonner of marrying sakharov for his money and said the couple lived in oriental luxury amid scandals between spouses
moscow news depicted the couple as living peacefully and frugally eating cabbage beet soup potatoes and other simple fare and marveled that sakharov a member of the prestigious academy of sciences always does the dishes himself
while sakharov was in exile in the closed city of gorky the author of a book that accused him of leading a luxurious and scandalridden existence came to ask for an interview moscow news said
sakharov put a copy of his book in front of him and proposed that he write an apology for all the lies that were published the paper said
it reported that when the unidentified author refused sakharov said its too bad that duels are abolished in our times and slapped him
sakharov has been quoted numerous times by soviet media since his return from exile but the article in moscow news was the longest devoted to him so far
but most of the newspapers circulation is among foreign tourists and readers abroad so relatively few soviets would see the sakharov article
as well as appearing in russian moscow news also prints editions in english french and other languages
soviet media once branded andrei d sakharov a traitor but a moscow weekly has now provided a sympathetic portrait of the human rights activist and his wife
this weeks issue of the newspaper moscow news said that sakharov long ago understood the need for change in the soviet union
the article makes a clear attempt to refute some of the past charges leveled at sakharov and his wife fellow dissident yelena bonner by soviet officials and the statecontrolled media
moscow news also pointedly notes that the  nobel peace prize winner has praised mikhail s gorbachevs campaign for social and economic reform
the yearold sakharov and his wife lead a frugal existence in their seventhfloor moscow apartment eating cabbage beet soup potatoes and other simple fare and sakharov insists on washing the dishes afterward himself the paper said
it said their tworoom home was always filled with people seeking sakharovs aid and that the words most often heard there are help me
although the fullpage article was the longest on sakharov to date in the soviet press it made only indirect reference to the nearly seven years he spent in exile after criticizing the kremlins intervention in afghanistan
sakharov a brilliant physicist was allowed to return to moscow in december  from his forced residence in the closed city of gorky where he was banished without trial in january 
in effect sometimes sakharov bitterly jokes that hed like to return to gorky for a few months to be able to work alone on scientific work moscow news said
since his return to moscow sakharov has been a vocal supporter of gorbachevs program for nationwide reforms that includes the policy of glasnost or greater openness on selected topics
he simply believes that something helped change the thoughts of the majority into state policy moscow news saidhe calls perestroika restructuring an enormous event for our country and for the entire world
however sakharov has insisted on speedier progress in improving the soviet record on human rights and during a jan  meeting in the kremlin he handed gorbachev a list of  people he said were imprisoned for their views
moscow news noted that in  in a tract titled knowledge and the world sakharov set forth his views on soviet affairs
now we can definitely see parallels between what he said then and those ideas that we are putting forward today moscow news said
the human rights activist one of the most prominent members of the dissident movement that reached its peak in the s sought openness in soviet society years before glasnost became communist party policy
much of the moscow news article seemed designed to undo harm caused to the sakharovs by previous press campaigns against them
it said one soviet book accused the sakharovs of living in oriental luxury and engaging in scandals between spouses
moscow news said sakharov was stubborn unassuming an undisputed member of his countrys intelligentsia and a man with his own views on how to deal conscientiously with world affairs and the demands of this life
his strong convictions even extend to his insistence that he do the dishes after meals wrote the reporter who visited sakharov at his apartment
the visit by human rights activist andrei d sakharov to the united states has gone virtually unreported by state media with a radio broadcast saying only he had voiced opposition to the us star wars program
that report from radio moscow carried on its internationalservice news programs tuesday apparently was the only mention made by soviet media of sakharovs visit to the united states which began sunday
radio moscow said sakharov made the comments about the reagan administrations spacebased antimissile program at a boston news conference
sakharov winner of the  nobel peace prize is scheduled to spend two weeks visiting relatives in the united states undergoing medical tests and promoting a new international organization he belongs to
a celebrity in the west since he helped form the soviet dissident movement of the s sakharov spent nearly seven years in internal exile after criticizing the kremlins military drive into afghanistan
some statements and articles by sakharov have been printed in the soviet media since then including an article last week in a magazine that opposed some elements of gorbachevs blueprint for political and electoral reforms
other activities by sakharov have gone unreported here including his delivery to gorbachev of a list of  soviets reportedly held in prison labor camp or psychiatric hopsitals because of their political views
the official tass news agency reported wednesday that the organization sakharov belongs to  the international foundation for the survival and development of humanity  held its first session in boston the previous day

andrei d sakharov the father of the soviet dissident movement finally received a  human rights award thursday night during his first trip to new york city
sakharov received the human rights award from the international league for human rights at a reception at the home of ronald lauder the former us ambassador to austria
the yearold nobel peace prize winner is on his first trip to the west less than two years after soviet leader mikhail gorbachev freed him from internal exile in the city of gorky
about  guests including author elie wiesel brooklyn district attorney elizabeth holtzman designer caroline roehm and abc televisions barbara walters attended the reception
sakharov wearing a blue beret and plaid scarf made no statement as he left the reception and entered a waiting limousine
sakharov is the honorary president of the league which has its headquarters in the united states and more than  affiliate groups around the world including the moscow human rights committee which sakharov and his colleagues founded in 
sakharov arrived in the united states on sunday to visit relatives and receive medical treatment before going to washington for a white house visit and a board meeting of the international foundation for the survival and development of humanity of which he is a director
andrei d sakharov urged members of the academy of sciences on monday to reject the leaderships list of candidates for the new soviet legislature which does not include the nobel peace prize winner
the yearold nuclear physicist and human rights activist who won the nobel in  said in a speech to the academy that many scientists objected to the slate for sundays election approved by the leadership in january
the official news agency tass quoted him as saying however that scientists were upset not because sakharov was not nominated but because the role of scientific institutions was ignored
he called for reversal of what he called the antidemocratic decision which produced a list of what critics describe as oldguard managers of scientific institutions
sakharov was nominated from several geographic districts for a seat in the new member congress of peoples deputies but he decided to refuse the nominations and fight for an academy of sciences seat
under an election law approved in december  seats in the legislature are reserved for the communist party and its affiliates and for professional social and trade union organizations
those in the academy who support sakharov hope to force a new round of nominations by mustering enough support to deny all nominees a majority said andrei mironov a former political prisoner
that would force the academy to start over and produce a new list of nominees under terms of the new election law
tass said  academicians corresponding members and representatives of reseach institutes attended the threeday meeting that began monday
the first three days of this week may become the hottest spring days for soviet scientists it said alluding to the leaderships rejection of such reformers as sakharov space scientist roald sagdeev and sociologist tatyana zaslavsakaya
in what amounted to a public apology mikhail s gorbachev and soviet leaders today eulogized andrei d sakharov as a man of honesty and sincerity who suffered great injustice at the hands of previous rulers
an obituary signed by gorbachev five other members of the ruling communist party politburo and  other leading officials and scholars was printed along with a picture of sakharov on page  of the party daily pravda
such obituaries are reserved for favored public figures and scientists and pravda emphasized the importance of the  nobel peace prize winner by printing a decree about the formation of a funeral commission in a black box on its front page
sakharov  died thursday night in his study just hours after urging fellow members of the congress of peoples deputies to create a formal opposition to the party in their drive to break its sevendecade strangehold on political power
a distinguished scientist and public figure a man of honesty and sincerity has passed away the obituary said
it was signed by gorbachev and fellow politburo members nikolai i ryzhkov vadim a medvedev lev n zaikov alexander n yakovlev and vitaly i vorotnikov
however the signatures of several other politburo members including kgb chief vladimir a kryuchkov and leading conservative yegor k ligachev were missing
it was leonid i brezhnev now blamed by gorbachev for permitting stagnation and corruption to overcome the soviet system who exiled sakharov for criticizing the soviet intervention in afghanistan
the soviet leader told reporters at the congress of peoples deputies that sakharovs death was a great loss
gorbachev said he would attend sakharovs funeral monday afternoon in southwest moscows vostryakovskoye cemetery
several hundred people gathered outside sakharovs apartment building friday evening holding candles and wreathing his photograph in flowers
memorial services were scheduled sunday at the citys main youth center and on monday at the lebedev physics institute where sakharov worked and the academy of sciences of which he was a leading member
the popular nighttime tv program vzglad showed a brief interview with his widow yelena bonner discussing the funeral arrangements
the obituary also praised sakharovs vision as a scientist which made him the youngestever member of the academy of sciences at age  and led to his inclusion in a group that developed the soviet hydrogen bomb
working on the creation of weapons of mass destruction ad sakharov understood early the danger for humanity of their wide production and testing and stubbornly placed before the government the question of limiting such tests it said
mourners sobbed and shook their heads in disbelief sunday as tens of thousands viewed the flowerdraped body of andrei d sakharov in a huge outpouring of grief for the man described as his countrys conscience
crimean tatars and jewish refuseniks  two of the groups sakharov helped  joined rankandfile communists teachers and engineers in filing past the body of the physicist nobel peace prize winner human rights advocate and legislator
a friend of the family speaking on condition of anonymity said he heard estimates that  mourners viewed the body before it was returned to sakharovs apartment at midnight
one elderly woman cried out as she saw sakharovs body in an open coffin sloping to the floor of the beige marble youth palace in central moscow
a mound of red and white carnations grew steadily at sakharovs feet and a spotlight was focused on a portrait showing sakharov with his hands over his mouth deep in thought
sakharov died thursday alone in his study at the age of  apparently of a heart attack ending a threedecade fight against the jailing of innocent people for free emigration for disarmament and other causes
sunday was the first of two days of memorial ceremonies and the outpouring was remarkable for a man who was once ostracized and committed to nearly seven years in internal exile in the remote city of gorky
there were signs of grief throughout this snowy capital of  million people as though a government leader had died
the huge line of mourners sometimes four deep and heavily bundled against belowzero temperatures stretched a mile from the palace and poured continuously out of a subway station
so many people wanted to see sakharovs body lying in state that authorities extended the viewing period by four hours and moved the coffin so two rows of mourners could file past
roald z sagdeyev a member of the official funeral commission said about  people an hour were arriving initially but the official news agency tass said that rate doubled later making for a total of  by nighttime
sakharovs widow yelena bonner pleased authorities were not turning people away praised them for being very democratic
i would not wish a living person  he has lived an animated happy life  to be turned into an icon an icon which could be used by various forces in their interests bonner said in an interview broadcast on soviet tv
she said however that she hopes sakharovs writings published abroad long ago will become widely available in his homeland so there can be a conversation of the people of the future with andrei dmitrievich
mourners carried small portraits of sakharov and red and white carnations to place near his coffin
my daughter who is being brought up with the belief that there is nobody greater than soviet founder vladimir lenin i have brought her here today just to show her the person greater than lenin he said
he was like the man from one of maxim gorkys tales who used his own bleeding and living heart as a torch to lead people to light and truth said the woman a teacher who declined to give her name
sakharov always was telling the truth and by doing so forced our leadership to do the same said boris sorokin a yearold designer
unofficial shrines sprouted outside sakharovs southeast moscow apartment where candles flickered alongside his portrait
outside the offices of the weekly newspaper moscow news on pushkin square a popular gathering place for political activists portraits and flowers were displayed
an entry in a notebook for mourners comments outside sakharovs apartment building declared the conscience of the nation has died
moscow news  an organ of the official press which had branded sakharov an utterly ignorant person  took the rare step sunday of publishing a special edition devoted to the activist
four pages were filled with pictures of him condolence telegrams from exiled writer alexander solzhenitsyn and president bush and a text of sakharovs last public remarks a speech he delivered hours before his death in which he said the soviet hierarchy was leading the country to a catastrophe
on sunday night soviet tvs newscast seven days also paid tribute to sakharov leading the program with a minute report on him
the communist party daily pravda published a poem by yevgeny yevtushenko that read in part historys most peaceful rebel in dying did not come down from the cross but left a horrifying hole in the moral fabric of the world
president mikhail s gorbachev and other soviet leaders said in an obituary that sakharov had been the victim of gross injustices and praised him as a man of honesty and sincerity

in a major rebuff to the soviet unions scientific establishment soviet physicists friday nominated nobel laureate andrei d sakharov to run as a candidate in nationwide parliamentary elections scheduled for march
the overwhelming vote in favor of the yearold humanrights advocate by his colleagues at moscows leading physics institute came only two days after his candidacy was rejected by the governing board of the academy of sciences
during a marathon session that ended late wednesday the governing board of the academy of sciences selected  scientists as candidates to fill  specially reserved seats in the new congress of peoples deputies
sakharov and several other leading reformers including the former director of the soviet space institute roald sagdeyev failed to win nomination
sakharov supported during secret balloting friday at the prestigious lebedev institute the physicists supported sakharovs candidacy by a vote of  to 
the outcome was more an expression of respect for sakharov as a man who stuck by his principles during difficult times than a specific endorsement of all his political views
sakharov however used the occasion to outline his hopes for a multiparty system public control over the kgb security police and the convergence of communism and capitalism
although sakharov has publicly expressed his support for president mikhail s gorbachev in recent months he seems to have become increasingly concerned about the slow and uneven pace of reform
sakharov who acted as an unofficial kremlin envoy to the troubled transcaucasian region last month said he was particularly dismayed by a government crackdown against leading armenian nationalists
he called for the release from prison of members of the outlawed karabakh committee which has been campaigning for the secession of the largely armenianinhabited region of nagornokarabakh from azerbaijan
the  nobel peace prize winner outlined a detailed political program which if implemented would totally transform the soviet union
although sakharov has now been nominated as a candidate from the october electoral district of moscow it is by no means certain that his name will appear on the march  ballot
under the complicated voting procedures it is still possible to strike down his candidacy during the socalled preelectoral campaign if more than two candidates have been nominated
soviet human rights activist andrei d sakharov said sunday that his country is on the brink of economic catastrophe because reforms of the old centralized system are too slow in arriving
while praising the new course in world affairs taken by the soviet union as demonstrated by its withdrawal from afghanistan sakharov told the congress of the italian socialist party that some aspects of internal affairs are deeply disturbing
economic reforms are proceeding slower and slower and people are losing interest in them because they cant buy anything
sakharov who did not mention the name of president mikhail s gorbachev described as antidemocratic some measures taken to quell nationalist unrest particularly the toxic gas believed to have been used against demonstrators in soviet georgia earlier this year
speaking in russian without notes he said the new laws were supposed to take the place of measures used against dissidents like himself in the s and s
sakharov was elected in april to the new soviet congress of peoples deputies just two years after he was released from seven years of internal exile
world leaders from president bush to president mikhail s gorbachev today praised andrei d sakharov as a tremendous force for freedom who outlived his soviet persecutors and saw the liberty he championed take root throughout eastern europe
the yearold scientist and human rights activist died thursday of an apparent heart attack in his moscow apartment
the soviet congress stood for a minute of silence for their colleague once considered a national hero for discovering the soviet hydrogen bomb but later reviled by kremlin leadership for his uncompromising stands for human freedom
gorbachev who freed the physicist from seven years of internal exile called sakharov a man of conviction and sincerity
bush in a message of condolence to sakharovs widow yelena bonner said all of us who knew him will never forget his courage and devotion to freedom
aase lionaes chairman of the norwegian nobel committee that awarded sakharov the peace prize in  said he fell in the struggle for democratic reforms
his death represents a great loss especially at a time with hopes of a positive development in the soviet union and in all eastern europe
political leaders worldwide commended sakharov as a man whose causes went beyond ideology
lech walesa a fellow nobel peace prize laureate said sakharovs death was a great loss for reform both in the soviet union and everywhere else
he was one of those who would always say the truth must be found and was never afraid of stating that and letting everyone know
in strasbourg france the member european parliament unanimously paid tribute to sakharov whose name it had given to its human rights prize
in brussels the nato foreign ministers hailed sakharov as a pioneer who helped change soviet society
nato secretary general manfred woerner said the ministers expressed deeply felt sense of loss at the passing of andrei sakharov

the bodies of  sailors killed in the gun explosion on the iowa arrived in the united states on thursday as the navy tried to figure out what caused the battleships turret to blow up
they discarded a theory that the blast had been sparked by redhot debris left in the guns breech by earlier rounds

asked about the ships safety bush said he wanted to insure that procedures were checked to be sure that safety is at the highest point  but i wouldnt jump to the conclusion that because that kind of powder was put into these turrets in that way that makes a useful platform obsolete
adm richard d milligan a former commander of the new jersey began the board of inquirys investigation
seaquist said a pressurized air system that clears debris from the breech at a guns rear must be operated manually
each gun has a oneinch diameter tube carrying air under  pounds of pressure to blow debris from the foot barrel
phillip edward buch from las cruces nm who would normally be in a small compartment at the rear of the swivelling top of the turret adjacent to the room in which shells are loaded

the inch guns on the uss iowa which can lob a shell the weight of a volkswagen  miles have an outdated design that is unfit in the nuclear missile age critics say
they all ought to be eliminated retired rear adm eugene larocque of the center for defense information said thursday
i dont know what more it takes to get people to recognize this ancient technology is no longer appropriate on warships
but the navy defended the inch gun the mightiest in use on any ocean after an explosion killed  sailors wednesday aboard the battleship iowa while a turret crew loaded gunpowder for target practice
the main criticism is that the big gun requires gunpowder packed in silk bags to fire inchdiameter shells from its footlong barrel
it works like the breechloaded guns that roared during the civil war a shell is placed into a barrel and then charged with gunpowder in a separate package
in the iowas case  pounds of powder  six pound bags  is needed to fire a projectile weighing up to  pounds at a speed of  feet per second
the extremely flammable silk is supposed to burn away during the burst but some redhot debris may remain or explosive gases can build up in the barrel
air pressurized to  pounds per square inch can be blown into the breech to clear away debris to guard against a blowback which happens when powder ignites before the breech is closed
james bush of the center for defense information a private think tank often critical of pentagon policy said the iowa explosion could have been caused by smoldering debris a blowback or a mishap in the handling of powder
the navy said thursday that none of the guns in the iowa turret had been fired before the explosion took place
the navy also on thursday placed a moratorium on firing the big guns found only on the iowa and its three sister battleships the new jersey the wisconsin and the missouri
the mile range of the inch guns is almost worthless in an era when missiles can be fired at much greater distances
the iowa first launched in  was the first of an entire class of us battlewagons built to conquer japan
it supported marine amphibious landings and shelled shore targets but the aircraft carrier emerged as the navys top weapon because naval battles were waged without ships ever seeing each other
the iowa and three sister warships were ordered out of mothballs in the reagan administrations military buildup six years ago
one of the battleships the new jersey bombarded syrian and druze positions in lebanon as part the us peacekeeping role in 
but the inch guns often missed their targets which the navy blamed on unreliable powder from world war ii

 turret stood on top of the fireblackened turret as the ship pulled into the pier with full crews on the ships two other turrets the navy said
when the foot vessel first appeared there were scattered cheers by those on the dock but all remained silent as the ship pulled into the pier
the navy kept the news media about  yards from the families and reporters were not allowed to talk with the families or the crewmen
the detonation which appears to blast away the gasketlike rubber bloomers that seal the turrets gun slits is followed by a jet of intense fire and thick smoke from the front and base of the gunhouse
the videotape cut immediately to damage control firefighters spraying heavy streams of water onto the turret
throughout the norfolk area churches dedicated prayers sunday morning to the families of iowa crewmen
a red rose a yellow ribbon with the number  on it and a book containing the names of the dead were taken to the altar
fitzgerald said the iowa tragedy and that of a recently lost soviet submarine put political differences aside and unite the human family as one
on monday morning president bush will lead a memorial service in a base hangar that can accommodate  people
the guns the largest on any ship at sea use six pound bags of black powder to fire a pound projectile up to  miles
 guns breech open and undamaged with the practice projectile that the gun was to have fired still there the new york times reported sunday
this indicated the explosion occurred while the powder bags were still being loaded into the gun the times said citing unidentified sources
navy gunnery officers believe the explosion occurred when the bags were being transferred from a powder hoist to the gun the newspaper said
they said flame and hot gases from the blast went down the hoist to the lowest deck if the transfer of powder to the guns had been complete the hoist would have been sealed off
the iowa and its sister ships the battleships missouri new jersey and wisconsin were commissioned during world war ii and mothballed after the korean war
defense secretary dick cheney said sunday that the administration plans to keep all four battleships in the fleet despite the explosion
they are effective they were relatively cheap to bring back into the service compared to new ships they are good cruise missile platforms so i think they do have a role to play cheney said on nbcs meet the press
critics have charged that the battleships inch guns are antiquated and dangerous gunners say they are among the most accurate available
navy investigators will be looking at all possibilities of human or mechanical error in their effort to determine what caused the explosion that killed  aboard the battleship uss iowa officials say
it could take months before the probe is completed and the results released publicly navy spokesman lt cmdr
theyre looking at any evidence of human error or mechanical error or anything technical said lt janet mescus a spokeswoman at the navys information center at norfolk va the ships home port
theyre moving as quickly as they can lt mescus said but added they want to be thorough and that takes time
there were  survivors inside the turret all on the lowest deck loading powder from the ships magazines the navy said
dooley said no information would be released until the probe is completed and the navy has refused to speculate on the cause of the explosion which damaged only the inside of the turret
but the new york times reported sunday that navy teams who entered the turret immediately after the blast found the no
the times cited unidentified sources as saying this indicated the explosion occurred while the bags containing  pounds of propellant powder were still being loaded into the gun
navy gunnery officers believe the explosion occurred when the bags were being transferred from a powder hoist to the gun the newspaper said
they said flame and hot gases from the blast went down the hoist to the lowest deck if the transfer of powder to the guns had been complete the hoist would have been sealed off
the navy on sunday released an amateur videotape of the explosion which was made by an officer on the bridge of the iowa who wanted to record the firing of the guns
the investigation team is headed by rear adm richard d milligan former commanding officer of the battleship uss new jersey and it also includes experts on gunnery and weapons
thousands of grieving friends and relatives of the fallen  crewmen from the battleship uss iowa gathered quietly monday and heard president bush praise their loved ones as brothers in eternity
we join today in mourning for the  who perished and in fact for the  who survived the president told a packed memorial service at norfolk naval air station
they came to the navy as strangers served the navy as shipmates and friends and left the navy as brothers in eternity
the president a world war ii navy pilot said he was proud to recommission the iowa in  and said it had earned  battle stars in two wars
fred p moosally said the turrets crew was the best gun crew on the ship and called its chief  chief gunners mate reginald owen ziegler of port gibson ny  my no
victims relatives and hundreds of sailors and officers in dress blues were among the  people crowded into a hangar for the service
a bouquet of red roses was placed in front of the podium behind were an american flag and the battleships banners
as many as  iowa crewmen were unable to attend the service because they were delayed by traffic and were not permitted to enter the hangar because of security measures to protect bush
the service came a day after the world war iiera battleship eased into its home port its gun barrels scorched and its  crewmen at the rails in white uniforms and black armbands in memory of their dead shipmates
i remember their faces as they toiled at their guns sweating an honest sweat that comes from young men dedicated to a great cause he said
i remember as they talked among themselves looking so much like sailors of the past sharing the exuberance of the times and the dreams of the future he said
bush recounted seeing the iowa off the coast of the philippines as a naval aviator in world war ii and the great sense of confidence the big ship lent to the fleet
at the end of the service while the navy hymn was played president and mrs bush greeted and consoled the families of the lost men
at a press briefing following the reception moosally praised the hundreds of men who fought the fire for their courage
besides the firefighting crews we had cooks engineers deck seamen marines all fighting to save the ship
moosally said the blast occurred just as he was turning to vice adm jerome johnson commander of the nd fleet to tell him to watch the no
moosally refused to give a definite answer to reporters questions about whether the damaged turret could be repaired saying the battleship could operate without it if necessary
all but  men in the huge gun turret died almost instantly last wednesday when the explosion ripped through it
john p morse the iowas weapons officer said the guns were thoroughly inspected the morning of the accident and moosally said he had no hesitation about the guns safety
one of the survivors gunners mate rd class kendall l truitt  of tampa fla said that at first the men down in the powder magazine in the lowest level of the turret didnt know anything was wrong
when the men discovered that no one was answering the interior turret communications link truitt ordered the powder returned to the magazine and the compartment evacuated
the sailors found smoke everywhere as they climbed through hatches and up ladders outside the turret toward the sea deck truitt recalled
my first thought was that id better get to a lifeboat station because if the fire got to the magazine things would be bad he said
a fiery explosion in a giant gun turret rocked the refitted battleship iowa on maneuvers in the atlantic today killing at least  sailors and injuring an undetermined number the pentagon said
defense department spokesman dan howard said the explosion may have resulted from the blast of a pound gunpowder bag used to fire shells that weigh more than a ton a distance of up to  miles
another spokesman said at least  crewmen were killed in the explosion that ripped through the turret when one of the giant guns was being fired during a training exercise about  miles northeast of puerto rico

guns date from  defense secretary dick cheney and joint chiefs of staff chairman adm william crowe were informed of the incident while attending a nato defense ministers meeting in brussels
the guns are originals dating from the ships first commissioning at the height of world war ii in  as a sister ship of the missouri aboard which the japanese signed the warending surrender document
defense officials traveling with cheney said seawater was pumped into the magazine where the fire and explosion occurred
each of the ships nine guns requires a crew of  to  to operate it with  to  people in the turret and the others below sending up shells and powder bags
the iowa itself has been refurbished many times since it was commissioned and was most recently put back into service in december 
the ship was deployed in the persian gulf region between september  and february  as a symbol of americas ability to strike deep into iran
a dozen of the  sailors killed in an explosion aboard the battleship iowa have undergone pathology exams and an official said four of them were dressed in full military uniform and sent to their hometowns saturday for burial

hurricane hugo struck south carolina with renewed fury thursday after thousands of coastal residents in southeastern states grabbed what they could carry and fled inland on jammed highways
this is a disaster staring us right in the eye mayor joseph p riley jr said from his city hall command post in charleston where the hurricane downed power lines snapped trees and caused utility transformers to explode
all we can do now is pray and hope all the precautions we have taken have been sufficient riley said as hugos eye bore in on the city
the roof cracked at city hall a yearold brick building that has withstood several hurricanes and torrents of water poured into the paneled council chamber
hurricaneforce winds first hit the coast by  pm edt and about three hours later the eye of the storm passed over the isle of palms just east of charleston said bob sheets director of the national hurricane center in coral gables fla
hugo was expected to turn gradually to the north causing severe flooding as it moved up the east coast
the storm posed a  percent chance of hitting new york city and a  percent chance of hitting boston before sunday night the hurricane center said
as hugo neared the coast roads from hilton head to myrtle beach  miles north were nearly empty as were the boardedup resort towns themselves
one eyewitness said its like a light show said amy garrison a reporter at wkzq amfm in myrtle beach
hospitals stockpiled supplies discharging any patients well enough to go and moving others to hospitals inland to make room for emergency patients officials said
about  people had checked into  shelters across the state as of thursday evening and more were expected said bennish brown a spokesman for the emergency operations center in columbia  miles northwest of here
we tried to close the doors but people are sneaking in side doors said elaine skelton a registered nurse working at the conway high school shelter near myrtle beach
american red cross relief efforts were buckling under the number of evacuees said brian ruberry a spokesman in savannah ga who appealed for help
at midnight the center of hugo was near latitude  degrees north and longitude  degrees west forecasters said
near its center hugos muscle reached winds of  mph up from  mph earlier in the day and  mph the day before
north and south carolina can expect tornadoes linked to hugo for the next two days according to the hurricane center
the coastal area could expect hurricane force winds for  to  hours once the eye comes ashore officials said
a hurricane warning was in effect between fernandina beach fla and oregon inlet nc by late afternoon hugo was upgraded to a category  hurricane on the saffirsimpson scale of strength the second mightiest category which indicated it could cause extreme damage
it strengthened more than we thought it would sheets said adding that hugo would cause severe flooding as it moved up the appalachians
the timing of the landfall was critical because of the storms tidal surge a dome of water  to  feet high that would feed a normal foot high tide that peaks after  am on top of that will be waves sheets said earlier and in many places on barrier islands the buildings will be swept clean off
this historic city has survived the ravages of earthquake battle and storm in its storied yearhistory but it faced perhaps its greatest test of all in hurricane hugo
this is a dangerous killer hurricane the likes of which few people who have lived all their lives in charleston have experienced warned mayor joseph p riley jr hugo was the first major hurricane to strike charleston since hurricane gracie came ashore  miles to the south in 
the worst in recent decades was in  when a tornado tore through the city killing  people injuring hundreds and causing an estimated  million in property damage
charleston a city of pastelcolored antebellum structures lining quaint streets and alleyways is where the civil war began in 
the city has survived the shot and shell of two wars and any number of smaller hurricanes politely referred to by charlestonians of refinement as september gales
but the worst natural disaster to beset the city occurred on the hot night of aug   when the ground rumbled in what some folks thought was a prelude to judgement day
measuring  on the richter scale of ground motion the earthquake claimed an estimated  lives destroyed  buildings and tossed most of the citys  chimneys into the streets
in recent years the city has attracted millions of visitors annually who tour its historic buildings and visit its nearby fine sand beaches
charleston has received international acclaim as home to spoleto festival usa founded by composer gian carlo menotti
amid the uproar of live coverage by the major networks and scores of other media organizations national hurricane center forecasters went about their business of monitoring hurricane hugo
on one side of a large room dominated by a ushaped bank of monitoring equipment were the forecasters making meticulous calculations about where the deadly hurricane will strike and getting emergency operations going in those areas
on the other side were the media  a pack of reporters camera operators and technicians jockeying for seconds of sheets time and tidbits of his expertise
surrounded by cameras wires and two dozen journalists with pads and telephones the ubiquitous redheaded meteorologist has appeared on television all week next to a large satellite monitor showing colorful images of hurricane hugo
during prime news time competing technicians and cameramen shout and make rude hand gestures for people to get out of their shots of sheets
at his back casually dressed forecasters who have been working hour days tracked the storm via computers and satellites
we obviously dont like this and could probably do a better job but everyone knows now because of the media said hurricane specialist max mayfield
when a hurricane warning goes into effect its a  million statement said meteorologist joel cline referring to the cost of emergency preparations and evacuation plans that must be implemented when the warning is posted
before the hurricane warning system was established a storm of hugos power would have cost thousands of lives
but early today after days of warnings and proper evacuation procedures there were no immediate reports of deaths despite widespread damage in charleston and other coastal areas of south carolina
after hugos landfall sheets and the other forecasters began to wind down from the hectic pace they had maintained for the last several days
but he warned the hurricane center still is following three other weather systems that have moved into the atlantic between the united states and africa and another storm in the pacific
i hate to say were breathing a sigh of relief because people are getting clobbered to death meteorologist mark zimmer said as the storm pounded charleston sc but weve done all we can
supercomputers satellites and the expertise of several hurricane forecasters predicted the destructive path hurricane hugo would follow giving people plenty of time to flee the south carolina coast
forecasters at the national hurricane center used computer models to track hugos path into charleston sc all the worlds knowledge about meteorological conditions and forecasting changes in those conditions is embodied in those models said thomas pyke head of national oceanic and atmospheric administrations satellite service
pinpointing the exact point of hugos landfall was difficult but forecasters said friday that the landfall was predicted in time for evacuation
overall i think the tracking models gave us a very good idea where hugo would be so officials in south carolina could act in a timely manner said research meteorologist colin mcadie
the real forecasting problem with hugo was predicting the intensity of the storm which was upgraded to a category  hurricane just hours before it slammed into charleston
the hurricane specialists were surprised by the lastminute increase in wind speed which was reported to them by air force reconnaissance
hurricane specialist gil clark who has tracked hurricanes for  years said that a couple of decades ago the only forecasting tools were reports from aircraft or ships
information from the satellite is used to improve the accuracy of the largescale models that television viewers see every night
using the information from the satellite supercomputers at the national meteorological center in suitland md send information to the hurricane center where a tracking model constantly changes to account for current weather conditions and the position of the hurricane
to determine the track of the storm the forecasters analyze supercomputer predictions satellite data the history of similar storms and the current path of the hurricane
meteorology professor kerry a emmanuel of the massachussetts institute of technology criticizes the current forecasting system
congress and the american people are suffering from the collective delusion that our data problems have been solved by satellites and that just isnt true emmanuel said
satellites can give a pretty picture he said but not enough information about the wind and temperatures that affect a hurricanes path
most of the information actually used to predict hurricanes comes from flying airplanes into the hurricane and they do a very good job emmanuel said
forecasters say the accuracy of satellite pictures is improving every year so longrange forecasting should become more precise
we have to remember that those models used are only guidance products pyke said and that its ultimately the job of the forecaster to predict the storms path
here is a chronology of hurricane hugos destructive path across the caribbean into south carolina sept   forecasters monitor new tropical wave forming off west africa southwest of the cape verde islands
sept   no casualties are reported on the island of st kitts but houses are damaged and communications nearly severed
in the us virgin islands the popular tourist islands of st croix and st thomas are hard hit
some reports say prisoners escaped from jail and were roaming free and national guardsman and police were joining in the looting
sept  midnight  hugo crashes into charleston sc with winds of  mph leveling buildings and flooding streets
sept   the hurricane with steadily diminishing winds continues to move inland and is downgraded to a tropical storm
twelve hours later it had all but lost the characteristics of a tropical storm and was weakening although the weather system featured maximum sustained winds of  mph and torrential rains
its last location was just west of pittsburgh pa at latitude  degrees north and longitude  degrees west
the greenhouse effect may breed bigger and deadlier hurricanes in the future storms up to  percent stronger than hugo and last years recordsetting gilbert some meteorologists say
hugo blasted the eastern caribbean and the carolinas with  mph winds this past week killing at least  people
that made it among the  strongest hurricanes this century to hit the united states the national hurricane centers miles lawrence said today
gilbert whose winds reached  mph tore up the caribbean last year killing  and causing  billion damage
gilbert seems to be about the upper limit of a hurricane with current ocean temperatures said kerry emanuel of the meteorology department at the massachusetts institute of technology
but if the seas warm up say by  to  degrees fahrenheit the wind speeds might be  percent higher  which means the destructive force would be more like  percent higher he said
stephen schneider deputy director of the national center for atmospheric research in denver said his research suggests the warming trend is already here
schneider an expert on the greenhouse effect and author of a new book global warming said six of the  hottest years in the last  occurred in the s
hugo demonstrated the effect of warm atlantic waters when its winds jumped from  mph to  mph as it passed over the gulf stream before hitting the east coast schneider said
emanuel said if the ocean temperature climbs moderate hurricanes of the future could grow to gilberts strength  and future gilberts will be even stronger
gilbert was so strong that bob sheets director of the national hurricane center said forecasters may have to use an intensity scale of  in the future instead of the current  with five the highest
the computer models schneider uses show that in a worstcase scenario over the next  years the worlds temperature could jump by  degrees if carbon dioxide and methane gas  which both contribute to the greenhouse effect  continue to pour into the atmosphere unchecked
it is possible that even though the world as a whole heats up the caribbean could somehow remain cooler
residents took forecasters at their word when they warned of hurricane hugos fury and the low number of deaths from the powerful storm can be credited to this healthy respect authorities said
the storm which caused billions in damage claimed  lives in south carolina and only two were in the charleston area which bore the brunt of hugos  mph winds
we just feel very thankful about that said mayor joseph p riley jr several thousands of people who were in the shelters and the tens of thousands of people who evacuated inland were potential victims of injury and death
riley and other officials credited residents with monitoring the hurricane as it spun toward charleston and heeding evacuation warnings
the last big storm to hit south carolina was hurricane david in  which hit the coast after pounding southern florida
since then several big storms have threatened but veered away and officials were worried that charlestonians wouldnt heed hugos warnings
weve had so many close calls said gary garnet a meteorologist with the national weather service
glen ellis a red cross official estimated that  residents in charleston and the three surrounding counties headed for shelters
mayor john bourne of north charleston where there apparently were no stormrelated deaths credited people for heeding the warnings
meanwhile garnet had some good news for stormweary charlestonians late saturday the tropics were quiet with no other storms brewing
the two dominant home and automobile insurers in the carolinas said tuesday that they expect to be hit with about  million in claims from hurricane hugo
state farm insurance co expects claims as high as  million in south carolina where it insures one out of every five homes spokesman jerry parsons said
the bloomington illbased company is also projecting an additional  million in claims from storm damage in north carolina and virginia he said
additionally nationwide insurance co said it expects claims close to  million more than triple the  million that the company paid for damages caused by hurricane elena when it swept through florida alabama and mississippi in 
our previous alltime high was in  when we paid  million in comparable claims for hurricane alicia which struck galveston and houston
officials said property damage from hugo escalated because the storm scored a direct hit on charleston and then instead of heading out to sea veered northwest hitting other population centers including charlotte nc losses still being tallied nationwide based in columbus ohio is the biggest home and auto insurance in north carolina where damage was unexpectedly high and is the thirdlargest insurer in south carolina
although claims adjusters are still tallying the losses there is now little doubt that overall damage to insured property will far exceed the record  million in claims paid by the industry after hurricane frederic struck mississippi and alabama in  parsons said
the insurance information institute is expected to issue a report thursday on overall insured losses from hugo
although the losses are substantial they are not expected to threaten the financial health of any individual company because reinsurers will pick up a significant portion of the costs
for example nationwide said it would be responsible for up to  million in claims while its reinsurers would cover up to  million in damages
reinsurers  which share a portion of the risk on an insurance policy in exchange for part of the premium income  typically spread their risk over many hundreds of companies
analysts said most of the claims will be borne by mutual insurance companies which are owned by policyholders but they noted that losses from hurricane hugo would also affect the shortterm earnings of some publicly traded companies
continental corp said it expects to report a pretax charge of  million for the third quarter reflecting its net exposure to damages from the storm
the new yorkbased company had substantial business in puerto rico and the virgin islands where hugo first struck with devastating force
forecasts may be cut the charge might push continental into the red for the quarter said udayan ghose an analyst with shearson lehman hutton in new york
ghose said shearson may also cut its thirdquarter and annual earnings projections for cigna corp usfg corp and lincoln national corp which are expected to suffer hurricanerelated losses equal to about  of expected fullyear earnings
overall  catastrophic losses for the industry now total about  billion and analysts expect hugo to make this year the costliest
but this could be a positive for the industry ghose said explaining that the industry is in the middle of a price war because it is overcapitalized
billions of dollars in losses from hugo and other catastrophes this year would have a significant impact on excess capital he said causing insurance firms to raise prices shortly
damage from hurricane hugo which stormed through the carolinas and the caribbean last week will reduce thirdquarter earnings for several insurers
new yorkbased american international group inc expects net losses related to hugo to reduce pretax earnings between  million and  million
analysts said aig has told them that it must cover the first  million of losses and that its reinsurance agreements will cover the bulk of the remaining damages
aig insured property in puerto rico the eastern caribbean islands and the coastal regions of the carolinas
st paul cos based in st paul minn said the pretax cost of hugo shouldnt exceed  million
that amount takes into consideration what st paul expects to recover under its reinsurance contracts the company said
philadelphiabased cigna corp is expected to disclose hugos likely impact on its earnings sometime today
udayan ghose an insurance industry analyst at shearson lehman hutton in new york estimates that cignas thirdquarter pershare earnings could be reduced by between  cents and  cents a share on an aftertax basis
state farm mutual automobile insurance co said its state fire  casualty co unit estimates claim payments from hugo will exceed  million in south carolina alone far surpassing the companys record payout for a single disaster
it said that is more than three times the previous record of  million set by hurricane alicia which hit the houstongalveston texas area in

a pentagon source said us navy ships were diverted to the region but president bush said the subject of intervention was not being discussed
the iraqi government of president saddam hussein claimed it invaded at the request of revolutionaries who had already staged a coup and established the provisional government of free kuwait
the assault followed two weeks of tension between kuwait and iraq caused by iraqi accusations that kuwait stole oil from a disputed border area
saddam also accused kuwait of exceeding opec production quotas thus driving down the price of oil a major iraqi revenue source
the attack had wideranging ramifications oil prices soared  a barrel in early trading because of fears the invasion would disrupt supplies
president bush signed orders freezing iraqi assets in the united states and blocking most iraqi imports including oil
oil accounts for  percent of iraqi imports to the united states and makes up about  percent of us oil consumption

a pentagon source said the aircraft carrier uss independence escorted by a sixship battle group was diverted from the indian ocean toward the gulf where other us ships were already patrolling

kuwaits us ambassador sheik saud nasir alsabah told reporters in washington we are desperate for any help we can get
bush said the united states would take whatever steps necessary to defend interests in the gulf
iraq has emerged as the arab worlds strongest and most militant military power and saddam has a vast arsenal of chemical and conventional weapons
diplomats said about  iraqi tanks wheeled into the capital a few hours after crossing the border  miles away at dawn
diplomats said sheik fahd alahmed alsabah one of the emirs brothers was killed while trying to defend the palace
operating from an unknown location alahmeds government responded to the formation of the provisional government by stating kuwait is kuwait to its people let by the emir sheik jaber and his crown prince sheik saad
for its part the provisional government announced through baghdads official iraqi news agency that it was dissolving parliament and would hold free and honest elections at a future date
baghdad television said iraq qould withdraw its forces within days or weeks depending on how quickly the situation stabilized
diplomats said the invasion was too swift to arrange the evacuation of nationals and foreigners were asked to keep a low profile
us officials monitoring the situation had no reports of harm to us citizens in iraq white house spokesman roman popadiuk said
the british embassy was hit by shellfire and the sheraton and hilton hotels evacuated their clientele the diplomats said
iraqi first threatened military action against its former ally kuwait two weeks ago
iraqi president saddam hussein seemed determined to solve his financial problems and fulfill territorial ambitions by dethroning the government of neighboring kuwait
the invasion unprecedented in modern arab history reflected the brutality saddam has used to crush all opposition at home since coming to power in 
the sentence for criticizing saddam is death and the president considered kuwaits oil overproduction and the subsequent fall in the price of oil a personal affront to iraq
oh god almighty be witness that we have warned them he said last month after prices tumbled below  per barrel
he accused kuwait and the united arab emirates of costing iraq  billion in lost oil revenue by ignoring their quotas assigned by the organization of petroleum exporting countries
he also accused kuwait of stealing  billion by pumping oil from a disputed field that straddled their border and demanded that kuwait write off an estimated  billion it loaned iraq during the persian gulf war
saddam said he fought the war to protect the arabs from the fundamentalist revolution fomented by the late ayatollah ruhollah khomeini in persian mainly shiite moslem iran
never mind that iraq started the war in  by invading iran after a series of border skirmishes along the shattalarab waterway iraqs only outlet to the gulf
despite claims that the war was an unprecedented victory the long conflict stalled iraqs development dragging on for eight years
the war bills kept the government from delivering material benefits promised to the iraqi people directly after the war
tens of thousands of iraqi prisoners of war languish in iranian prisons and an estimated  iraqis were killed or wounded
despite its puny size kuwaits oil reserves almost match iraqs  billion barrels
by controlling kuwait saddam could help solve the financial hangover from the persian gulf war and fulfill iraqs longstanding wish for more gulf coastline
iraqs  troops massed at the border in the past few weeks were believed part of a pressure campaign to make kuwait capitulate to iraqs demands
but kuwaits pledge two weeks ago to obey new opec quotas and saddams promise to egyptian president hosni mubarak that he would not invade lulled the arab world into the sense the crisis was over
homage to the cause of arab unity has been paramount in middle east politics since postwar independence from colonial powers
although a civil war in yemen in the s brought egyptian and saudi arabian intervention on opposing sides no arab state has ever directly deposed the government of a fellow arab league member
despite iraqi claims that it is helping internal opposition liberate kuwait it has long coveted the tiny emirate
the iraqi government refused to recognize its independence in  and threatened to attack then but backed down when britain landed troops in kuwait
it proved the decadeold gulf cooperation council that groups saudi arabia bahrain qatar the united arab emirates oman and kuwait was toothless
while iraq was unlikely to invade saudi arabia it could use the precedent of kuwait to browbeat its neighbors on local policy issues
bombing an oil field would be a sufficient reminder of what happened to kuwait when it balked at iraqi demands
also in a region entirely ruled by absolute monarchs the fall of one makes the rest feel extremely vulnerable
in a series of bellicose statements in recent months saddam has sought to focus domestic attention outside iraq
in march he threatened to burn half of israel with iraqs chemical weapons  banned under international law  if iraq was attacked
it was a popular stance among arabs frustrated with the lack of progress toward peace and a palestinian nation in the arabisraeli conflict

president bush embargoed all trade with iraq and froze the nations assets in the united states on thursday while refusing to rule out the use of us troops to rescue kuwait from its iraqi invaders
the trade embargo bars imports of oil from iraq which account for  to  of total us oil supplies officials said
the move also prohibits iraq from buying us grain and other foodstuffs which represent the other chief element of trade between the two nations
iraqs naked aggression against kuwait has created an emergency in the persian gulf bush said in a speech to the aspen institute a nonprofit organization that focuses on global issues
the trade embargo represents the strongest international response so far to iraqs massive invasion of its small and poorly defended neighbor but it stopped short of the military intervention requested by desperate kuwait officials
but according to bush administration sources the pentagon stepped up air patrols in the persian gulf and began moving warships equipment and supplies into the area in a signal to iraq that the united states would act to halt further aggression

in a related development the state department confirmed that invading iraqi troops had rounded up six american oil field workers near the border of kuwait
despite bushs refusal to rule out military action it appeared an unlikely option given the strength of iraqs military the limited us forces in the region and the opposition to us intervention from other countries in the area

even so the strongest economic weapon an international ban on iraqi oil exports also appears unlikely to be employed

bush flew to colorado after meeting early in the morning with his national security council to discuss the persian gulf situation
before leaving the capital thursday morning bush told reporters at the white house that he was not contemplating any us military involvement
the trade embargo imposed by bush would cut off all commerce with iraq except news reporting exports of publications and shipments of emergency relief supplies of food and medicine
iraq is highly dependent on oil exports to finance its large armed forces and considerable national debt
but europe and japan are far more dependent on middle eastern oil than is the united states and an international oil embargo on iraq would be painful for many us allies

the late jesse owens whose performance at the  olympics put the lie to hitlers boasts of racial superiority picked up a fifth gold medal wednesday for humanitarian contributions in the race of life
president bush presented the congressional gold medal to his widow ruth owens in a ceremony at the white house also attended by three daughters and teammates of the track legend

the olympics like democracy are a kind of dialogue  a way that nations can converse in the language of friendly competition not deadly conflict bush said
bush called owens who was black an olympic hero and an american hero every day of his life  born with the gift of burning speed
he was always the fastest said bush recalling the afternoon in may  when the ohio state runner broke three world records and tied a fourth in the space of  minutes
at the  olympic games in berlin owens captured four gold medals  in the broad jump meter dash meter dash and meter relay
the berlin games were to be the showcase of hitlers theories on the superiority of the master race until this yearold kid showed up bush said
bush borrowing a phrase from ruth owens said it was not those athletic feats but his humanitarian contributions in the race of life that earned owens the congressional gold medal
he said the athletes legacy lives on through the jesse owens games a playground olympics the jesse owens international trophy for amateur athletes and the jesse owens foundation which awards scholarships to needy youth
despite the many honors his greatest satisfaction came from his work with youth said mrs owens 
attending the ceremony along with owens family were former olympians mal whitfield harrison dillard and herb douglass former teammates john chavers samuel devine and chester thomas and two ohio democrats sen howard metzenbaum and rep louis stokes who spearheaded the drive to strike the medal
the silverhaired mrs owens standing outside the white house afterwards called the event absolutely beautiful
what the relays demonstrate more clearly than any other athletics event is that at the olympics the race has traditionally gone to affluent countries  or to those rather that choose to lavish resources on athletes

the  summer olympic games werent even over when advertisers began clamoring for pixie gymnast mary lou retton
ad agency executives who spend every fourth year glued to their tv sets hoping to pick out the next star to hawk their clients products say that this olympiad was a dud
i suspect this will go down as the dullest in the history of the olympics says jerry della femina chairman of ad agency della femina mcnamee wcrs
who could forget diver greg louganis smacking his head on the springboard then coming back to win two gold medals
but even these two along with jackie joynerkersee who won the womens heptathalon and the long jump may find it more difficult than in previous years to turn gold medals into gold in the bank
i dont think its big money like it used to be says michael goldberg of national media group inc the new york sportsmarketing firm that represents ms retton
certainly this years winning olympians will have no trouble securing contracts from specialized sportsequipment outfitters and speaking invitations from obscure trade groups
but the major highpaying endorsements  such as those with softdrink companies and fastfood outlets  just dont seem to be surfacing at least not yet
earlier this year sports marketers estimated that a gold medal won during the summer games could earn a personable athlete more than  million in endorsements
for one thing they suffer by comparison with the  summer games so exciting because they were held in los angeles and because in the absence of boycotting sovietbloc countries the americans won  gold medals
the  games by contrast were broadcast from halfway around the world and the soviets trounced the americans  gold medals to 
whats more marketers say this years drug scandals cast a pall over the games especially the incident involving canadian sprinter ben johnson who lost his gold medal after testing positive for steroids
marketers say it was so bland and skipped so frequently from one event to another that there was little chance for excitement to build
the constant commercial interruptions which led to ratings that were much lower than expected didnt help either
during most of the past games there was enough continuous tv coverage so that much like a soap opera it was possible to get involved in the lives and in the competition says leigh steinberg attorney for iceskater brian boitano a gold medalist at the  winter games
recent changes in olympic rules meanwhile have led to a glut of olympians in search of endorsement deals
before the  games most olympic athletes werent allowed to make commercials unless they gave up their amateur status
now they can appear in as many ads as they want but the income must go into a trust fund for training expenses
every year more and more olympic people are out there wanting to do commercials  basically everybody is available says daisy sinclair a vice president with ad agency ogilvy group inc as a result while once an aura surrounded an olympian now the bloom is off
increasingly cost conscious they will no longer hook up with an olympian just because the company president likes the athletes sport
and after years of paying big bucks to olympic stars only to see them fade into obscurity companies have finally gotten the hint that olympian fame is of the most fleeting variety
if you think your phone will ring off the hook if you win a gold medal it isnt going to happen anymore says stephen disson senior vice president of marketing for proserv inc a washington sportsmarketing firm
it uses sports stars in its commercials for pepsi light and oppenheimer mutual funds but has no plans to call on any of s olympians
i prefer to use athletes who are in the public eye on a regular basis like football and basketball players says charles miesmer the agencys executive creative director
people like michael jordan have plus years in their sports careers all in a row so i dont have to worry about the public saying carl who
general mills inc which has featured ms retton and decathalon goldmedalist bruce jenner on its wheaties boxes in the past says it looks for three qualities in an endorser career achievement popular appeal and offthefield accomplishments
and according to her agent pearl hodge of world class management she is now in the process of signing with mcdonalds corp to work on behalf of its efforts to aid underprivileged children
ms joynerkersees sisterinlaw ms griffith joyner may soon take the endorsement lead
mr biondi has already signed a swimwear contract with arena usa inc and parkes brittain his agent at advantage international inc says his client will definitely be in a highincome ring the highest you can name
since winning two gold medals during the  summer olympics the diver has had little luck with major endorsements
when most advertisers are looking for the male hero the word macho trails along very closely says marty blackman of blackman  raber a sportsmarketing firm in new york
still other marketing professionals say that mr louganiss dramatic recovery after smashing his head has secured the divers future
 winning endorsements there is only one former olympian among the top sports endorsers of last year
