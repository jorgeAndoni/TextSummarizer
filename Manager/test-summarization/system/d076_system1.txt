On the Persian Gulf, Bush said he would not rule out possible military force, and ordered a huge buildup of troops to make his threat credible.
A crucial first vote of Tory Members of Parliament (MPs) is scheduled for today, and if Heseltine should wrest control of the party from Thatcher -- the longest-serving British head of government in modern times -- she would also have to give up the prime ministers job that she has held since 1979.
This puts (to rest) rumors that the queen and Mrs. Thatcher didnt like each other, said Harold Brooks-Baker, director of Burkes Peerage and an authority on the royal family.
She also encouraged Reagans nurturing of the huge Pentagon buildup, and backed U.S. efforts to install medium-range missiles in Europe, despite opposition from NATO allies.
Mrs. Thatchers popularity is the lowest of any prime minister since opinion polls began in Britain 50 years ago, and senior colleagues have publicly admonished her to change her leadership style following the surprise resignation of her treasury chief, Nigel Lawson.
It is no longer in the interests of the United Kingdom, which are now inextricably linked with the development of a strong and united Europe, for her to remain in office.
