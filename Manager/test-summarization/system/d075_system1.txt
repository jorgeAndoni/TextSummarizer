A drug that eases the hearts workload can cut the risk of new cardiac attacks and death by 20 percent in people recovering from heart attacks, according to a major study released Thursday.
The study was one of a series of recent reports showing for the first time that doctors are able not only to treat heart attacks _ but also to prevent them.
She added in a telephone interview yesterday that an extension of the study is under way, and researchers expect to report to the FDA in late fall.
In their paper, the doctors determined that 80 of the 507 heart attack patients studied were healthy enough to be considered for early discharge.
In an accompanying editorial, Dr. Gregory D. Curfman, a deputy editor of the journal, cautioned that the study was not large enough to spot complications that might result from reducing hospital stays.
In a study at the Jefferson Medical College in Philadelphia, a group of laboratory rats induced to have heart attacks suffered 50 percent less cell damage after injections of transforming growth factor beta than did rats that did not receive the TGF beta.
In patients whose hearts had pumping problems, the drug not only didnt help, but it increased the chance of a heart attack by 25 percent.
