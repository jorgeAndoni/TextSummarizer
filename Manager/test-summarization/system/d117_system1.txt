The six include Alan Hollinghursts The Folding Star (published by Chatto and Windus), a melancholy study of homosexual obsession which was tipped as a likely candidate from the initial long list of 15, The Reef (Granta) by young Sri Lankan writer Romesh Gunesekera and How Late It Was, How Late (Secker and Warburg) by gritty Glasgow realist James Kelman, which was almost universally well-reviewed.
As for the other three - Knowledge of Angels (Green Bay) a philosophical fable by childrens author Jill Paton Walsh, Paradise (Hamish Hamilton) by Zanzibar-born writer Abdulrazak Gurnah and Beside the Ocean of Time (John Murray) by 72-year-old Orcadian poet George Mackay Brown - frankly, they dont make the grade.
Jungle Book will get the retrospective vote, because it is the best-known today and has fashionable mythic overtones in the lost paradise of Mowglis jungle; its position on the list may also rescue it from schmaltzy Disney associations and confirm it as a serious novel about a young mans self-discovery.
The novel, a story of Scottish low-life narrated largely in Glaswegian dialect, is unlikely to prove a popular choice with booksellers, who have damned all six books shortlisted for the prize as boring, elitist and - worst of all - unsaleable.
