On Wednesday, Hawley is to grapple the 12{-ton telescope with the shuttles mechanical arm, lift it out of the cargo bay, point it, and _ after a long checkout _ drop it overboard to orbit on its own.
The lens cover on the Hubble Space Telescope opened today after a morning of worrisome problems, and Mission Control told the Discovery astronauts they no longer are needed to rescue the $1.5 billion instrument.
Terry said that even in the safe mode, one of the tape recorders in the telescope reads telemetry signals from all its systems and that these would be played to Earth and analyzed when the antennas are working properly.
After Wednesdays deployment, Shriver gently backed Discovery away from the telescope and put the shuttle through a series of maneuvers, the last one completed this morning, to park Discovery in orbit 46 miles behind Hubble.
The mission was delayed another two weeks when a faulty power unit on Discovery forced the National Aeronautics and Space Administration to halt the first launch attempt four minutes before April 10s scheduled liftoff.
For scientists, and then the rest of us, all that becomes possible now that the space shuttle Discovery has carried the Hubble Space Telescope into the sky to see what no one has seen before.
