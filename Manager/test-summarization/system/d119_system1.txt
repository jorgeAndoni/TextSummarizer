Helms questioned the appointment of a Democrat to the post, and Lugar expressed concern that Aronson had no experience with the economic issues facing South America, they said.
A report prepared by the State Department for the Foreign Relations Committee said Gildenhorn would make an excellent candidate for an ambassadorship because of his solid background in law and management.
When Bush telephoned him earlier this week, Shlaudeman agreed to the appointment, the U.S. official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Wednesday.
