Hurricane Gilbert, which has left nearly one in four Jamaicans homeless, slackened somewhat as it swirled over land, but the storm was beginning to gain strength over open water as it moved toward the U.S. Gulf Coast with sustained winds of 120 mph.
Gilberts remnants should bring very heavy rains to Rio Grande valley before heading north up the Mississippi River Valley as a huge rain-making machine, said Mark Zimmer, meteorologist at the National Hurricane Center in Coral Gables, Fla. The danger of flash flooding in Texas is very great, Zimmer said.
The forecasters said the Dominican Republic would get as much as 10 inches of rain yesterday, with similar amounts falling in Haiti last night and tonight.
Communications were down with many storm-ravaged areas and the death toll was expected to rise with the arrival of damage and casualty reports.
Cozumel is south of Cancun and the reports said hotel guests also were being moved to more secure areas away from the shoreline.
There is very serious flooding in the Cayman Islands, Erina Nichols, a tourism official in Miami, said Tuesday after speaking with residents of the islands.
The shower and thunderstorm activity that we see taking place around the hurricane itself is getting better organized, more vigorous, so we think its starting to strengthen, said Bob Sheets, director of the National Hurricane Center in Miami.
