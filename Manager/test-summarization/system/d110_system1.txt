In a statement carried by the Iraqi News Agency on Sunday, the Iraqi-installed military government of Kuwait warned other nations not to take punishing measures against it or Iraq.
The executives said the Saudis believe this would give Iraqs belligerent president, Saddam Hussein, an excuse to attack and occupy Saudi oil fields 150 miles south of Kuwait, giving Iraq control of more oil than any other country in the world.
The sanctions were intended to force Iraq to withdraw its troops from Kuwait and the resolution bans the import into their territories of all commodities and products originating in Iraq or Kuwait and exported there from after the date of this resolution.
The statement said Saudi Arabia was following the Kuwait situation with extreme concern and that King Fahd would be seeking to calm the situation and to find a solution in a manner ensuring the interests of all.
The statement also said the Al-Sabah family, which had ruled Kuwait for almost 250 years, was working in concert with Zionist and colonial powers to plot against Iraq.
In a rare display of solidarity, the United States and the Soviet Union called for Iraq to withdraw and imposed sanctions.
Iraq struck back against the West today, rounding up hundreds of foreign nationals in Kuwait, as the U.N. Security Council overwhelming approved sweeping trade and military sanctions against Iraq to punish it for invading the emirate.
