They expressed their deep concern for the people in the flood-hit areas, as well as extended their warm greetings to the vast number of cadres, officers, and men of the Peoples Liberation Army; armed police officers; and public security police who battle on the frontline against floods and provide disaster relief.
In the past, inadequate consideration has been given to urban flood control and the coordination of urban and rural flood control.
More than half a million Armymen and local residents, under the leadership of the Hunan provincial party provincial committee and provincial peoples government, are going all out to fight the flood.
While inspecting flood control and relief work in Jiangxi Province, through which the Ganjiang flows, Wen Jiabao, alternate member of the Political Bureau and member of the Secretariat of the CPC Central Committee, said the flooded areas should work hard to mitigate losses through their own efforts and with support from various departments.
Under the current circumstances, the broad masses of Army personnel and people across the province should further step up their work and devote more energy to flood prevention and disaster relief work, this being an overriding task at the moment.
Regarding the work in the next stage, he pointed out: We should continue to take flood fighting and relief tasks as the focus of our current work and simultaneously do a good job of reform, opening up to the outside world, stability, other fields of work, and industrial and agricultural production.
