Born to an electrician father and pianist mother on Aug. 6, 1911, in a suburb of Jamestown, N.Y., Miss Ball had set her sights on stardom almost from the first.
From her star-struck childhood through her struggles as a wisecracking movie actress in the 1930s and 40s to the television career that made her a legend, Miss Balls life was in the best show business tradition of rags to riches.
Miss Balls real, onscreen pregnancy marked a milestone in television, and an estimated 44 million viewers _ more than for the inauguration of President Eisenhower _ tuned in on Jan. 19, 1953, to watch Lucy Ricardo have Little Ricky.
I think the thing I remember most about Lucy was that she was very much in control of everything, said Thibodeaux, who began playing the drums at age 2, was a professional drummer at age 4 and is now drummer with David and the Giants, a Christian rock group.
In 1984, when she was named one of seven initial inductees in the Television Hall of Fame, she credited the many talented and creative people around her for making her a legend.
The high-spirited star of I Love Lucy, a show that the nation took to its heart as no other and that continues in syndication around the world, died of a ruptured abdominal aorta at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, hospital spokesman Ronald Wise said.
