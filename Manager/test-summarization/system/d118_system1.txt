The FBI is trying to determine whether Tower, who left the Senate in 1985 after 24 years, received illegal corporate campaign contributions from a military electronics firm that later became part of Unisys Corp., sources said Friday.
But a senior member of the Armed Services Committee, who asked not to be identified, said Friday that the new allegation, if true, suggests that the former Texas senators drinking problem may be ongoing and that his confirmation remains in doubt.
In announcing Tower as his choice for the post on Dec. 16, President Bush called the talk a lot of rumors that proved to be groundless.
Bush said he had been fighting for the right of a president to appoint his own Cabinet, but he avoided language that would have raised the political stakes.
Towers Testimony Tower told the committee in written and oral testimony that he was employed only by the American unit of British Aerospace and that he worked chiefly on selling the companys commercial jets to U.S. airlines.
Johnston said his reading of the FBI report on Tower leaves him with the clear impression that Towers personality changes when he drinks heavily, leading to a recklessness in the social sense entirely different from his behavior when sober.
