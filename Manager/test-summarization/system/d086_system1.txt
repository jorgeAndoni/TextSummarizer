President Bush embargoed all trade with Iraq and froze the nations assets in the United States on Thursday while refusing to rule out the use of U.S. troops to rescue Kuwait from its Iraqi invaders.
The crisis began July 17 when Saddam accused Kuwait of trying to wreck the debt-ridden Iraqi economy with oil overproduction and began massing troops on Kuwaits border.
Iraq had moved about 100,000 troops to its border with Kuwait after claiming that Kuwaits production of oil beyond quotas of the OPEC cartel had depressed the world price, thus diminishing Iraqs revenue, and that Kuwait had been stealing oil from a field that straddles the border.
Aug. 1 _ Iraq pulls out of talks on the 2-week-old border, oil and money dispute with Kuwait shortly before it sends its forces to invade the oil-rich sheikdom.
Iraq also said Saturday that it was creating a new Kuwaiti army and that 100,000 Iraqis, the approximate number of soldiers Baghdad took over Kuwait with, had volunteered for the new military force.
Iraq has responded to the request from interim government of free Kuwait and decided to cooperate with it, the Iraqi statement said.
_The White House said that 11 American oil workers rounded up after the invasion had been brought to Baghdad, talked with U.S. Embassy officials, and were in good shape.
