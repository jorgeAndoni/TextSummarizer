Sakharov arrived in the United States on Sunday to visit relatives and receive medical treatment before going to Washington for a White House visit and a board meeting of the International Foundation for the Survival and Development of Humanity, of which he is a director.
Sakharov was nominated from several geographic districts for a seat in the new 2,250-member Congress of Peoples Deputies, but he decided to refuse the nominations and fight for an Academy of Sciences seat.
The obituary also praised Sakharovs vision as a scientist, which made him the youngest-ever member of the Academy of Sciences at age 32 and led to his inclusion in a group that developed the Soviet hydrogen bomb.
Sunday was the first of two days of memorial ceremonies, and the outpouring was remarkable for a man who was once ostracized and committed to nearly seven years in internal exile in the remote city of Gorky.
Four pages were filled with pictures of him, condolence telegrams from exiled writer Alexander Solzhenitsyn and President Bush and a text of Sakharovs last public remarks, a speech he delivered hours before his death in which he said the Soviet hierarchy was leading the country to a catastrophe.
While Sakharov was in exile in the closed city of Gorky, the author of a book that accused him of leading a luxurious and scandal-ridden existence came to ask for an interview, Moscow News said.
