; It is possible that, unwilling to take a huge risk and openly side with the hard-liners at the start of the coup, Gorbachev had decided to become ill and wait out the initial phase under virtually self-imposed confinement in his summer residence.
; As Gorbachev and Yeltsin met, a crowd of about 1,000 people headed toward the Communist Party headquarters in Moscow, saying they wanted to capture and preserve records that might prove the party supported the coup.
; Coup leader kills himself; One of the coup leaders, Interior Minister Boris Pugo, committed suicide Thursday by shooting himself in the head as he was about to be arrested, officials said.
; Gorbachevs foreign minister, Alexander Bessmertnykh, who had dropped out of sight during the coup, reappeared today and called the takeover a page in Soviet history that has got to be turned.
The thinking goes like this:; With his popularity at rock bottom, Gorbachev, a lifelong creature of the KGB, hatches a false coup in order to step out of the way while hard-liners and liberals battle each other.
; In the United States, President Bush hailed Gorbachevs return to power and said the coup leaders had underestimated the power of the people, underestimated what a taste of freedom and democracy brings.
