Tass said Gorbachev made other proposals on how to resolve ethnic tensions, including an increase in power for each of the countrys 15 republics, a law on equal use of the more than 100 languages spoken in the Soviet Union and some economic autonomy for the countrys republics and regions.
With serious ethnic clashes in Soviet Central Asia over the past month, with troops needed to maintain the peace in the southern republics of Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia and with nationalism growing stronger in the Baltic republics of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, Gorbachev is struggling to hold the Soviet Union together as a state while he pushes broad reforms that he believes will resolve most of the grievances.
Demands Rejected But he declared at the same time his firm opposition to near-total independence demanded by some nationalists, particularly in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, and to the calls by others for the redrawing of the borders of ethnic territories.
Tajik communists leader Shodiy Shabdolov told ITAR-TASS on Monday [16 May]that the disintegration of the Soviet Union and the parade of sovereignty that followed it have led to economic and political chaos in all republics.
Although limited so far in scope, some of the ethnic conflicts could grow to the point where various regions of the country would be thrown into virtual civil war, Gorbachev suggested, and some national republics could find themselves in violent disputes with their neighbors.
