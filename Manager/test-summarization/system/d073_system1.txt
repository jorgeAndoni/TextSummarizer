But it quickly weakened to a tropical storm with 60 mph winds by the time it was centered about 70 miles east of the volcano.
; About 10 people in Moraza, a village on the western slope of the mountain, were refusing to leave, relief officials said.
; Philippine civil defense officials said that they had evacuated 19,369 people from villages within a 12-mile radius of the volcano by late Wednesday.
Residents of nearby Angeles panicked when a huge, gray-greenish mushroom cloud burst from the volcano and turned day to night.
; Areas around the 4,452-foot volcano covered by evacuation warnings were expanded to protect people against possible slides of volcanic debris that could be triggered by the rain, police said.
; An explosion of superheated gas, ashes and rocks from the mountain one week ago claimed 38 lives, and a larger flow over the weekend razed dozens more homes.
; Meanwhile, President Corazon Aquino dismissed a British newspaper report that Americans had warned her of possible radioactive contamination if the volcano damages nuclear storage sites at Clark Air Base, abandoned Monday by nearly 15,000 Americans.
U.S. geologists advising the Philippine government said most of Angeles was not at risk, apparently basing their assessment on earth samples indicating that earlier eruptions had reached the area on which Clark now stands but had spared what is now Angeles.
