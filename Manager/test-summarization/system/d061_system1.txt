Hurricane Gilbert swept toward Jamaica yesterday with 100-mile-an-hour winds, and officials issued warnings to residents on the southern coasts of the Dominican Republic, Haiti and Cuba.
The National Hurricane Center said a hurricane watch was in effect on the Texas coast from Brownsville to Port Arthur and along the coast of northeast Mexico from Tampico north.
Prime Minister Edward Seaga of Jamaica alerted all government agencies, saying Sunday night: Hurricane Gilbert appears to be a real threat and everyone should follow the instructions and hurricane precautions issued by the Office of Disaster Preparedness in order to minimize the danger.
In Washington, the Navy reported its bases at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and Roosevelt Roads, Puerto Rico, had taken various precautionary steps but appeared to be safe from the brunt of the hurricane.
If that happens in an area where theres plenty of moisture in the lower atmosphere (the bottom 10,000 feet or so), this convergence may lead to upward motion and cloud formation, Bleck said.
The forecasters said the Dominican Republic would get as much as 10 inches of rain yesterday, with similar amounts falling in Haiti last night and tonight.
As Gilbert moved away from the Yucatan Peninsula Wednesday night, the hurricane formed a double eye, two concentric circles of thunderstorms often characteristic of a strong storm that has crossed land and is moving over the water again.
