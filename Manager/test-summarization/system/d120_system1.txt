When the results of Tuesdays vote were announced about 6:20 p.m., both Heseltine and Hurd said that they would vote for Major in the scheduled third runoff ballot on Thursday and advised their supporters to do the same.
On Russia, Major said A Russia thats a good neighbor to the United States and West would be one of the finest things that this generation could hand down to the next.
The prime minister had picked Major from among backbenchers -- those who are not party leaders -- as someone to watch several years ago and regarded him, aides said, as a man of the people.
He has few enemies and is regarded as a leader who can unify the party and, associates said Tuesday night, lead the Tories to victory in the next election, which must be held within 18 months, at a time of the partys choosing.
