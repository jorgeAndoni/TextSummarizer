The young men whom we lost were murdered by common murderers who must be found and brought to justice and put behind bars for a very long time, she said following a tour of the schools wrecked barracks in Deal, southeast England.
The Irish Republican Army claimed responsibility for a huge explosion Friday that reduced a three-story military barracks on the southeast coast of England to rubble, killing 10 people and injuring 22, eight seriously.
An explosion rocked the Royal Marines School of Music in a southeastern coastal town today, causing one building to collapse and killing eight people, officials said.
Military targets on the British mainland have been attacked several times by the Irish Republican Army in the past year as part of its campaign to rid Northern Ireland of British rule.
The IRA said Mrs. Thatcher went to the British province with a message of war, but we still want peace and we want the British government to leave our country.
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said Monday the Irish Republican Army members who blew up the Royal Marines School of Music and killed 10 bandsmen last week are monsters who will be found and punished.
Although trainees at the school range in age from 16 to 20, Col. John Ware, principal director of music, said the slain bandsmen all were trained, adult musicians.
